The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of politics on Lebanese sports in the two most prominent sports fields, football and basketball, using the Spiral of Silence and the Two-Step theories investigated through a mixed methods approach (survey: fan participants, and interviews: professional players). Results showed that politics and religion play a major role in sports, especially through funding, and fans are affected by this former integration.  Results also indicated mostly negative attitudes towards this interference, and many have noted being affected by opinions related to teams and decisions that circulate on social media. The results pave the way to understanding how the sports-religion system intertwines in Lebanon, provides an assessment of fans’ and players’ behavior, and emphasizes the need for financial support for the teams’ and fans’ sustainability, as a recommendation to reduce this interference in a healthy manner.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""></span></p><h4><b>Introduction</b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From the ancient times of the Roman Colosseum to the present times of Yankee Stadium, the Super Bowl, and the Olympics, sports have played a pivotal role in societies across the globe. Taking into consideration that there is a lot at stake including power, money, as well as pride, sports is heavily linked with politics (Dunning 2013). In Lebanon, the case is not different. In fact, both religion and politics influence sports (Nassif and Amara 2015). In Lebanon, the major political parties have distinct religious affiliations and are tied to their own sports teams (Nassif and Amara 2015). The Future Movement political party is predominantly associated with Sunni Muslims and the Al Riyadi team in basketball and Al Ansar team in football (Reiche 2011) Likewise, the Lebanese Forces, another Lebanese political party mainly associated with Christians is a supporter of Sagesse basketball team (Najjar 2017). Similarly, the Progressive Socialist Party is predominantly Druze and is associated with Al-Safa football team (Reiche 2011). These are a few examples of teams and their political affiliations; however, the greater concern lies in attempting to answer the following questions: Why is there a dominance of politics and religion in sports in Lebanon, and where did these types of divisions originate? How do they influence the Lebanese sports field?   </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To help answer these questions, a historical overview is needed about the Lebanese political system.  By the end of WWI, Lebanon was under French mandate upon the partition of the Ottoman Empire, and it was the sub-unit of the French authority for Syria and Lebanon and managed from Damascus (Traboulsi 2012).  Even after independence was declared, French forces continued to exert their influence (Hakim 2019). In 1943, Lebanon formed a sectarian government that distributed the seats in parliament on a ratio of six to five in favor of Christians (Minorities at Risk 2004) and it was agreed that the president of the Lebanese Republic would be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister would be Sunni Muslim, and the president of the parliament would be a Shia Muslim (Minorities at Risk 2004).  A civil war erupted in 1975, spanning almost 30 years.  After the war ended, the Taif Accord was ratified by parliament in 1989 with the aim of “eradicating political sectarianism” as an essential national objective (The Taif Agreement 1989, p. 5). The Accord divided the seats of parliament equally between Christians and Muslims while also transferring much of the authority of the president to the cabinet (The Taif Agreement, 1989).   </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The succeeding foreign powers that occupied the nation and a large group of people with various religious communities that have coexisted inside Lebanon have not just contributed to the development of a modern state that revels in very rich cultural and religious diversities but also established a republic administered by a delicate balance of power (Salibi 1993).  This delicate balance, based on religious division or distribution, has permeated itself into different forms and discourses in the country, including but not limited to geopolitics, education, media, and sports.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This study attempts to identify how this integration influences the sports industry, with a specific focus on basketball and football. This is necessary to determine the ways in which these different sports can grow and develop. Lebanon offers a thought-provoking perspective on the study of sport and politics. While previous literature has looked into politics and religion in sports in Lebanon, no study has tackled this integration in detail, particularly taking into consideration fan attitude and behavior. This study is valuable in that it bridges that gap as it describes this integration in relation to the fans of basketball and football teams in Lebanon.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While the influence of politics on sports is obvious, the objective of this study is to investigate the details of this influence on football and basketball and its effect on fans and their opinion making process.  In doing so, the Spiral of Silence theory was used to investigate whether political figures and/or religious leaders impose a direct or indirect Spiral of Silence effect on the team and fans, given that the political/religious leader is the owner of the team or has strong political affiliations with certain political parties who sponsor (give financial help) those teams.  From this perspective, this study will try to understand whether the teams and fans avoid expressing their actual opinions in fear of losing the support of the religious/political figures who offer financial assistance to the team. In investigating these intertwined perspectives, the researchers will be able to also understand, through the Two-Step Flow model, whether the opinion leaders (e.g., politicians/sponsors/owners of the teams, or teams/players) transfer their thoughts to the followers (e.g., teams/players, fans) on how to behave concerning football and basketball and at which point one (owners, teams/players, fans)  becomes the opinion leader or the follower.  These types of connections are vital in aiming at offering solutions to combat political and religious power over sports.  In doing so, a sample consisting of sports fans were recruited to participate in a survey assessing the aforementioned concepts. In addition, qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with football and basketball players to understand these relationships from a team player’s perspective.  The methods are triangulated to understand how politics and religion influence and integrate with sports in Lebanon, mainly in basketball and football, as well as how the fans of these sports are impacted by this politics/religion sports relationship. </span></p><h4><b>Literature Review</b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The integration of politics in sports is not only exclusive to Lebanon but is a worldwide phenomenon and can be seen in Middle Eastern countries (e.g., Egypt) and European (e.g., Spain, UK…).  In 2007, the football fans in Egypt started organizing demonstrations against the government under the global and official banner of the Ultra-actions, statements and actions taken by the Ultras (Ennarah 2017).  They used their fandom as a means to vocalize about various political and social issues in the country, and the events of the 2011 Arab Spring further politicized the Ultras and transformed them into revolutionary figures (Ennarah 2017).  However, there were consequences to their efforts, such as stigmatization and eventually the government banning fans from attending football matches in stadiums, leading the team to lose their main space for expression (Ennarah 2017). </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the European context, La Liga (Spanish League) is considered as one of the most popular football leagues around the world; this is clearly indicated in the annual revenue of 4.479 billion euros in 2017-2018 (Casinellie 2019).  However, Spain is home to one of the biggest political rivalries in sports, and that is evident between Real Madrid and Barcelona with the political tension between these two teams dating back to historical events (Wallace 2013).  Real Madrid is known to be supported by the government and are therefore excused from paying taxes while Barcelona, being Catalonian, is required to pay high taxes to the government (Wallace, 2013). The latest political clash between the two teams occurred in November 2019 when the match was postponed due to protests in Catalonia (Vakulenko 2013). Fans were protesting the arrest of certain political figures that support the Catalonian doctrine. Moreover, during national games, there had been several clashes between the players from both teams, and this affected the overall tone of future games (Vakulenko 2013).   </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While the rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid has a different historical context, the interference of politics in the world of sports is clearly highlighted in the events, which makes the essence of this rivalry similar to Lebanon. This demonstrates that integration of sports and politics is phenomenon that occurs in different parts of the world.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Likewise, the Scottish experience of football is fierce, intense, and embedded in deep political and religious representations. Even after hundreds of years, the Catholic-Protestant rivalry is portrayed through football between the Celtics, founded in 1887 by a Catholic brother, and the Rangers, founded in 1972, which became a team of the Scottish Protestant working class (PA Team, 2018).  While the teams were professional and peaceful in the beginning, they soon became fierce rivals as both clubs and their fans vocalized their identities in direct opposition, with “Celtics being associated with socialism and Irish Republicanism while Rangers with conservatism and Northern Irish unionism” (PA Team 2018, para. 10). </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">During the games, the intensity of the rivalry is portrayed through political chants (Celtics chanting the IRA anthem to vocalize their desire to separate from the UK; Rangers chanting sectarian rife in the Ibrox or Parkhead stands), raising of flags, and in some cases, violence (Farah 2017). As Farah (2017) bluntly states, “a Celtic win is a victory for Catholicism and nationalism, while a Rangers victory is another step forward for the unionists and the Protestants” (para. 12). </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The heated rivalry and the events that often take place are not strange in Lebanon, and are embedded in political and religious undertones. With fans also chanting political slogans or raising party flags, with the occasional physical altercation between opposing teams. The situation in both European as well as Middle Eastern countries shows how embedded the concept of politics and sports is, and this study will examine these possible tensions in Lebanon.  </span></p><h4><b>Context of Lebanon and Lebanese Sports </b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lebanon is a country that has more than 18 religious sects. Since the formation of Lebanon, many political parties have formed. In fact, many of them who participated in the Civil War in 1975 still exist today, and they are active members of the current government or participating members within the Lebanese parliament. The political parties each represent a certain religious sect in Lebanon.  These politico-religious divisions have also been portrayed in sports, as each sports team is somehow a representative of one of the aforementioned political parties/religions. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since a specific religious group occupies each geographical area in Lebanon, it seems that the common situation is to have the sports teams of this geographical area that is occupied by a specific religion support the political party that represents the religion. For example, in basketball, Al Riyade is the team of Central Beirut. Central Beirut is mainly occupied by Sunni Muslims, who are represented by the Future Movement, and therefore fans of Al Riyade Club are mostly Sunni Muslims who support the Future Movement (Yee 2019). Football and basketball are considered to be the most followed sports in Lebanon. Both basketball and football leagues have teams from different areas and date back to the early 1930s and late 1940s. The year 1933 was historical in sports history as it signaled the birth of the Lebanese Football Association (Hawi 2009). This paved the way to official leagues.  For basketball, although teams have been around since the 1920s, the governing body, the Lebanese Basketball Federation was founded in 1947 (LBF 2021), however it was not until the 1992-1993 season that teams competed once again after the Lebanese civil war.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In football, The Classico, the game between Ansar and Nejmeh attracts the most fans and is considered the highlight event of the season. This match is usually played in the Camille Chamoun Stadium (known as Madine Reyadiyeh or literally Sports City). The stadium has 45,000 seats, and during such matches (prior to Covid-19), the stadium welcomes the audience in full capacity. Most of the fans prefer to physically attend the match because it is in the heart of Beirut and very close to the areas where the fans reside (Maugendre 2018). The rest would be watching from cafes or homes. Other matches that strike an interest to the fans are games between Nejmeh and Alahed due to hidden political tensions that spark a competitive status from the teams as they are represented by </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Haraket Amal</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (Hope Movement) and Hezbollah respectively, both from the Shia Muslim sect (Maugendre 2018).</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Basketball leagues have recently climbed up the ranks as one of the most-watched sports in Lebanon, especially in the last decade (Sharif 2017). One of the most popular matches in the numerous seasons is those between Sagesse and Riyadi, which are considered to be the most successful teams in the history of Lebanese basketball. These matches take place in either Manara (home stadium of Riyadi) or Ghazir (home stadium of Sagesse). The stadiums for these matches are usually full with more than 7,500 fans present.  All matches are publicized via different media channels and have high viewership ratings (Ipsos 2017). </span></p><h4><b>Table 1</b></h4><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Football Teams in Lebanon and their Affiliations</span></i></p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Football Team</b></td><td><b>Political Affiliation</b></td><td><b>Religious Affiliation</b></td><td><b>Owner</b></td><td><b>Number of fans</b></td></tr><tr><td><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">AlAhed</span></td><td><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hezbollah</span></td><td><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shia Muslim</span></td><td><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tamim Solayman</span></td><td><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">8,400</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nejmeh </span></td><td><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tayyar Al Mostakbal (Future Movement – ownership);

Many of the teams, whether in football or basketball, have reached a degree of fame that has attracted many fans and some of the teams have also gained international recognition (Sharif 2017) As a result, fans (as seen in the tables above) have become invested in these sports and have followed them and attended many of their games. </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Presence of Sports Federations  </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Lebanese Basketball Federation and the Lebanese Football Association are presided over by Akram Halabi (Maronite Christian) and Hachem Haidar (Shia Muslim), respectively, and divided based on political and religious agendas (Lebanese Basketball Federation 2022; Lebanese Football Association 2022). The federations include members from all the religions, but the main decisions are usually taken by the presidents and general secretaries (Nassif personal communication, June 6, 2020). </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Football and Basketball Funding</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Football is considered the most popular sports in Lebanon, and for years, no other sport was able to outshine its popularity (Reiche 2011; Sharif 2017). However, in the past years, basketball has started gaining popularity in Lebanon, and today, the number of followers has increased and almost surpassed that of football (Sharif 2017). This is due to the investment and the enormous financial support from businesspersons, sponsors, and banks that it has been receiving compared to football (Sharif 2017). Still, in most cases, the financial support has come with underlying political agendas. However, the result of this support was the drastic increase in the number of spectators during games over the course of the last few years (Attieh personal communication, June 5, 2020). </span></p><h4><b>Impact of Politics on Sports </b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nassif and Amara (2015) conducted a research study on sports, policy, and politics in Lebanon. According to the authors, the over-representation of religious communities in the sports industry within the nation to the detriment of developing a clear and functional structure is strongly existent in the national sport movement. In other words, there is a clear political and religious representation, whether regarding ownership, management, and/or team members, in each sports club or academy, and in the political and religious affiliation of the fans that support it. However, the type of impact and the extent to which the members involved (e.g., team players, fans, owners) affect the other is not clear. The national sport movement encompasses the numerous fans and spectators in the country that are in support of the various sports played. Numerous individuals within the sports industry end up landing in positions within certain federations since they are supported by a political party (Nassif and Amara 2015). The study indicated that 90% of the individuals working in sports organizations are not qualified for their jobs and were recruited because of political considerations (Nassif and Amara 2015). This only further proves the manifestation of politics and religion in the sports industry as an indirect form of power struggle.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nassif (2014) indicates that there is a great deal of corruption in the nation’s sports industry as a result of the meddling and intrusion by the political figures in the club administrations; thus, politicization of sports in Lebanon has been unavoidable. Political influence is predominantly linked to the administrators and fans and less so for the players (Nassif 2014). The Lebanese sports industry is becoming a sector where there is constant clashing between political parties, thereby going against the actual objectives of sports which are meant to unite people, bring them closer, and generate happiness and entertainment (Rieche 2011). The objectives are, instead, being replaced with hatred, division, and aggressive competition; especially in a country in where politics cannot be separated from religion due to the structure of the Lebanese system (in reference to the Taif Accord).</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The lack of transparency in the funding system and nepotism were common in this sector and lack of transparency in allocation of money to associations and different federations were expected (Rice et al. 1952).  Perhaps then, one of the main reasons Lebanon was not able to disentangle the involvement of politics in sports is the vital need for a financial sponsor or supporter, and when it comes to funding, a price is always paid. </span></p><h4><b>Theoretical Framework  </b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To further understand the influence of political and religious figures as club representatives and/or funders of the players and fans, the Spiral of Silence and the Two-Step Flow model are used. These theories are used to help determine the degree (e.g., Two-Step Flow) and independence of vocalization (e.g., Spiral of Silence) of opinions. </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spiral of Silence Theory</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Spiral of Silence theoretical framework was chosen for this study to account for the fact that sports fans might have herd mentality, moving with the crowd, or whose points of view, although dissimilar sometimes, might choose to conform to the overall trend of perspectives that link politics and religion to conditional fandom and support.  It is important to note that the Spiral of Silence is about people who conform to the opinion of the majority in fear of isolation (Gearhart and Zhang 2015). </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to Neumman (1974), the more a person's opinion is backed by the majority’s point of view, the greater the likelihood that they are prepared to communicate it in the public arena. Consequently, individuals who are identified to be in the minority tend to continue being silent and keep opinions to themselves owing to the fear that if they share their point of view, they will experience isolation. In the Lebanese sports context, this theory helps investigate whether the minority are able to voice their opinion about Lebanese sports teams, especially when these sports teams are controlled by a majority with specific political and religious affiliations. Furthermore, it is essential to mention that so far, no study known to the researchers on sports has utilized this theory to explain different factors related to the functionality of sports in Lebanon. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The hostile atmosphere that surrounds Lebanese politics and sports, as aforementioned in the literature review, can perhaps be linked to the fans’ reactions to opinion leaders and to the opinions of other fans. As Hayes (2007) suggested, people are more likely to voice their opinion in a friendly environment than in a hostile one, thus in hostile environments people might confirm, or become silenced (e.g., not claiming a different political affiliation than the group). </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> If indeed political or religiously affiliated sponsors are helping the team financially then fans might not speak out about the political/religious party or leader.  For example, if a person (a fan) is criticizing the team, then that means they are indirectly criticizing the political party that the sports team is affiliated with, and perhaps for the same reason they might remain silent.  </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Two-Step Flow Theory</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This particular theory was selected to represent the social influences that delineate the identity of the dominating opinion in every segment of the Lebanese sports community.  It deals with the role of the mainstream media in addition to the present day's social media influence. The theory makes the argument that notions and ideas will emanate from the mainstream media to leaders who are opinionated and thereafter from opinionated leaders to the segments of the populations that are less active and are less knowledgeable (Katz 1955). An opinionated leader is delineated as a renowned individual or entity that can influence or sway public opinion on the topic, subject matter, or notion that the leader is known for.  Often, opinionated leaders are business leaders, journalists, as well as celebrities or sports superstars. Lately, they have also included bloggers (Uzunoğlu and Kip 2013) as well as social media influencers. The engagement of opinions on social media known as “social percussion” has a great influence on the leading opinion of the day (Sāmbhar 2009).  This analogy of social percussion denotes that the leaders set the tempo, and all then march to the beat, speculating a bandwagon media effect from an active as opposed to a passive audience.  Social media serves as a powerful social platform for the spread of mass opinion, and it is one of the objectives of the study to explore the influence of opinion leaders on fan base in sports as well as the reaction of the latter on popular opinions set by the former. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the context of sports, the Two-Step Flow communication model delineates that information flows from the media to the general public are intermediated and facilitated by opinion leaders who tend to be more exposed to media messages and who exercise personal influence on the attitudes and the opinions of others (Choi 2015). Most of the people within the Lebanese sports federations have obtained particular positions simply because they are representatives or supporters of a political party (Nassif and Amara 2015).  This perhaps can negatively influence the further advancement of the team. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People tend to react to messages or opinions about matters that interest them but tend to avoid expressing their opinions about topics that might spark conflict or speak against their collective ideologies. Thus, the fans' decisions to accept or reject a given message and their values, options, and beliefs are the most important and influential elements that affect the acceptability of the theories under study.</span></p><p><i>Research Questions</i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">RQ1: What is the impact that the interrelation of politics and religion in Lebanon has on the sport (football and basketball), team, and fans?  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">RQ2: </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How does an interplay trichotomy exist in relation to sport opinion leaders, teams, and fans?  </span></p><h4><b>Methodology</b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This study makes use of mixed methods research design, which includes both quantitative (survey to understand fans attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews with team players) in order to depict the relationship between politics/religion and sports in Lebanon.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sample and Procedure</span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Interview </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In order to gain one-on-one insight that is comprehensive from the respondents regarding the subject matter in question, semi-structured interviews were conducted with various football and basketball players. These interviewees included ten professional players (1</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">st</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> division players), five football, and five basketball players from different basketball and football clubs across Lebanon. All interviewees were male except for one female (football). Due to the limited number of female football and basketball teams in Lebanon and the lack of their popularity compared to men’s teams, only one female football player was interviewed to get a female’s point of view and the influence of politics on women’s teams. The interviewees’ names are represented by letters and numbers in order to protect the privacy of the players. The basketball players were identified with the letter “B” along with a number while the football players were identified with the letter “F” along with a corresponding number in accordance with the order in which they were interviewed (example: B1 is the first player interviewed in basketball; F4 is the fourth player interviewed in football etc.).  The fifth player of each category (basketball and football) are captains of their teams.

Participants were asked to identify which sports team they are a fan of, their fan behavior (e.g., supporting the team), as well as their attitude about the sports team that they support (e.g., the best team) and if the team is affiliated with a certain political party. </span><b><i> </i></b></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Political and Religious Impact</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Survey participants were asked a series of eight questions related to their attitudes towards the influence of politics on sports, specifically on the sports team that they are a fan of.  These sets of statements were measured on a Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree.  Four additional questions were asked about religion’s influence on sports. </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Level of Engagement with Sports Team </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This variable measures the players’ level of support to the club and dedication in both football and basketball.

A total of 11 statements were used, four statements directly relating to the fan’s behavior such as “people ask my opinion about any game related to my favorite team,” and seven statements relating to the fan’s perceptions of the owners. All statements were measured using a Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree (Fans: α = .800, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">M</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> = 3.561 </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">SD</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> = .770; Owners: α = .779, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">M</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> = 3.345 </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">SD</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> = .570).  </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Influence of Opinion Leaders: Spiral of Silence </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The study aims to determine the impact of opinion leaders on the mass fan base and whether their political and religious status, along with their financial investment in the team, influence the fans in either way, positively, by providing them a sense of solidarity and loyalty, or negatively, by silencing the expression of fans.  Three statements were measured on a Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree (α = 758, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">M</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> =3.300, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">SD</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> = .819).  </span></p><h4><b>Results</b></h4><p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Demographic Analysis</span></em></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Participants (N = 295) were asked to specify their political and religious affiliations. Politically, 44% participants stated that they were independent; 17% stated that they supported Hezbollah party, 12% Future Movement, 7% Lebanese Forces, 5% Civil Society and Amal Movement, 4% Free Patriotic Movement, and the rest of the participants were divided amongst Phalanges, Progressive Socialist Party, and those who did not answer the question (2% each). However, the majority of the respondents’ religious affiliation were divided amongst Shia Muslim (46%), Maronite (20%), and Sunni Muslim (19%).  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All of the respondents who chose Hezbollah as their affiliated political party identified themselves as Shia Muslim, while  63% stated that they supported the Al-Ahd football team. Twenty-eight percent stated that they support other football teams whose religious affiliation is also Shia Muslim. Less than 4% support Ansar while about 6% stated that they do not support any football team. Similarly, out of the 12% who stated that they support the Future Movement (Tayyar el Moustakbal), approximately 91% were Muslim Sunna, and all support Al-Ansar football team. Moreover, out of the 23% of respondents who claimed they did not support any basketball team, 84% were Muslim Shiaa. In addition, out of the 17% who support Al-Ansar team, 94% support Al-Riyadi basketball team, which is also affiliated with the Future Movement; 91% of those are Muslim Sunna. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Among the 61 respondents who support Sagesse, 59% are Christians (72% Maronites) and 36% are Muslims (95% of which are Shiaa). Out of 87 respondents who stated that they do not support any football team, 72% were Christians. Out of 72%, 79% were Maronites. Finally, there was a variety of football and basketball teams that the 130 politically independent respondents supported. </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">RQ1: What is the impact that the interrelation of politics and religion in Lebanon has on the sport (football and basketball), team, and fans?</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Participants did not deny that sports in Lebanon, specifically football and basketball, are highly affected by politics and religion. The majority portrayed a more negative perspective on the influence of politics and religion on sports after stating that their favorite team is funded by political or religious groups.  </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Political Impact</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">More than half of the participants agreed that the team they support belongs to the political party they support, and roughly 50% stated that the political party they belong to funds the team they support. On the other hand, more than 50% of the participants who identified themselves as independent politically (44%) claimed that their favorite team is not funded by a political group. This suggests that the funding of their favorite team might come from independent donors or is funded by a religious figure or sect. While in the Lebanese context religion and politics are inseparable in most cases, there are teams funded by certain religious figures or are more known to have religious rather than political affiliations although the latter might still be interfering subtly. However, the fans might be unaware of that, and many fans tend to have a more positive attitude towards religion than politics, hence separating the former from the latter. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Approximately 73% of respondents claimed that the impact of politics on sports is not positive (disagreed or strongly disagreed), and 88% strongly agreed or agreed that politics affects sports negatively in Lebanon. Respondents agreed or strongly agreed that politics influences many factors including how a game is played (71%), how fans act (82%), how players are selected (70%), and how teams behave (75%). Also, 80% of the respondents believe that the teams are financed by political parties. However, when it comes to winning games, around 50% believe that politics interfere in the games’ outcomes.   </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Religious Impact</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mainly, 63% of respondents noted that the team they support is affiliated to the religious group they belong to or identify with.  Eighty-six percent of Maronites do not support any football team and roughly 50% of Shia Muslims do not support any basketball team. The rest are mostly divided amongst Riyadi and Sagesse clubs. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Slightly less intense than the effect of political integration, 72% of the respondents either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the fact that religion has a positive impact on sports. While this is still a high number, the negative impact of religion on sports is less dramatic since many might regard politics as dirty while religion is considered noble. Also, 80% agreed that religion impacts the way people participate in sports, and 58% admitted that religious affiliation affects the team they select to support. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Similar to fan responses, team members, or all interviewees, football and basketball, admit that sports in Lebanon is highly influenced mostly by politics. The majority of the players stated that religion and politics have a negative impact on sports, and many emphasized that sports should not interfere with politics. However, three interviewees, all basketball players, highlighted the positive aspects of the influence of politics for different reasons. For instance, player B3 argued that the financial support of the political parties on the clubs has a positive effect on the game in general and on the financial aspect in particular:</span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The integration of politics in sports helped Lebanese Basketball in two ways. The first factor is the financial support for the teams; the second factor is attracting the fans. The money factor is because of political clashes and that led to the support of these political parties to these teams.</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">B4, on the other hand, also focused on the financial aspect but emphasized the importance of having a financial supporter of an overlooked domain in Lebanon. He views political interference “in a positive way because political parties tend to support the teams financially, and this helps a lot because there are times when there are no sponsors to pay a huge amount of money [sic].” Similarly, B5 also highlighted another pragmatic aspect of interference of politics:</span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yes, I hate politics’ interference with sports, but I don’t really hate politicians interfering with sports as sponsors. For example, if someone wants to declare his candidacy for his next election, like why not choose a sports platform or a team as a sponsor [in order] to grab the attention of the fans…That’s not bad.</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, despite their statements, like the other players, both still agreed that this interference has its unfavorable outcomes. None of the football players expressed any positive aspects regarding this interference.  A possible explanation could be recent support that basketball has been receiving over football. Perhaps the new fame of many players is one of the possible reasons why the funding system in basketball is more welcomed than football. When asked about how politics and religion are integrated with sports in Lebanon and what the impacts of this integration are (questions 7 and 8 of the interview), the answers varied, but all pointed out the negative impact of this integration in the sports world.</span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Football </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All football players recognized the negative impact on sports of politics and religion in Lebanon, but there were various inputs regarding the issue. Some conveyed their belief that the impact is not that detrimental. For example, F2 and F5 both argued that while the influence is present and disadvantageous, there are ways to overcome or at least ignore its involvement. In her interview, when asked about the results of the integration, F5 stated that “[she doesn’t] think this [the results of the integration] is a big deal as long as it does not affect the teammates,” yet did not fail to recognize how it is not often the case and how teammates can be caught in the political battle. F2 provided a more progressive interpretation of the issue. While he also recalled the damaging effects, he believes that this issue can be mended if the “fans’ mentality” changes. F2 endorsed a more cultural and tolerant approach towards sports where political interference does not create a conflict of interest.  At the end of the interviews, all interviewees, particularly F5 and F2, stressed the importance of removing this interference to create a better environment for both teammates and fans. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Because of that [extremism], we hope these types of things go away…These issues [of political and religious intervention] are rarely found abroad and that positively impacts the game over there, so I am hoping this phenomenon disappears from our games (in Lebanon).” </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Statement by F2.</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“When politics gets involved, things may become dirty, and in Lebanon, it usually does. We must work to ensure that this is no longer the case.” </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Statement by F5.</span></i></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Basketball </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Basketball players were less determined to consider the interference of politics in Lebanon as negative. All interviewees agreed that each team is affiliated with a certain political and/or religious group, and player B5 even provided some examples. While most of the basketball interviewees had the same opinion as football interviewees, in the case of basketball, two highlighted some positive outcomes to this integration. For instance, B3 stated: “The clash between Riyadi and Sagesse helped basketball in one way and showed in the other way the problem that was present in Lebanon between Muslims and Christians.” In other words, B3 believes that the “cold war” between religions has been playing out on the basketball court by fans who feel that their teams, that represent a certain religion or sect, are a means to express their greivances towards the other by supporting their teams. A win for their teams means a win for their religion/political parties. Moreover, B5 stated that while interference is negative, any financial support from political candidates is welcome, because they can use this as an advantage for their political campaigns and connect with the people. In such cases, the financial aspect was considered more of a positive point than a negative point among basketball players.  </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Player Political Status and Personal Goals</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In questions 3 and 6, the basketball and football players interviewed were asked about their status within their teams in terms of the nature of their affiliation and their career goals. When asked to evaluate their motivation for wanting to win a game (patriotic vs. political), answers leaned mostly towards patriotism. Many found pride in winning for their country and not for their political party (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, and B4), but B2 and B5 pointed out that since teams represent political parties, it is inevitable not to represent them, and this sometimes overshadows a national or patriotic spirit. The players also highlighted other reasons. For example, F1, F5, B3, and B5 highlighted the importance of personal achievements and career growth in winning trophies, while F2 only stressed the financial aspect. Moreover, F2, F5, B1, and B2 also emphasized on the importance of sportsmanship and using sports to build an ethical environment. On the other hand, B1 and B3 did not give any national or political lean to the question and pointed out that playing or winning games was purely for financial or career-oriented reasons. This section clearly defined the conflict of prioritizing one’s loyalty to their country versus the political party of their team, and it was observed that most were inclined to serve their country. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Question 6 targeted a sensitive subject and asked players to discuss or comment about the player’s political affiliation vis-a-vis their team. None of the interviewees admitted their political affiliation except for B5, who stated that he prescribes to the same political views as his team, but he also emphasized the fact that his statement derives from a cultural perspective (Armenian bondage). He also stated that even if he is affiliated, he does not follow them blindly: </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I support this party, if I am talking about myself… but not blindly, you know. There is nothing wrong with people or athletes supporting political parties or having religious philosophies, but extremism and blind following is something that I don’t like and don’t practice.  I keep the balance between what is best for me and my team. In the end, it is a sport, so it is not a place where I fight for the cause of the political party; it’s not the case; definitely, it’s not how I work at least. So, I proudly support it because perhaps we as Armenians have a different approach to this idea. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All interviewees also highlighted the fact that one should not necessarily be affiliated to a certain political party in order to be part of the team. However, some did point out that there might be some favoritism and in certain cases, dismissal, if grave issues arose. For instance, B4 stressed on the fact that while one does not need to be affiliated with the team’s politics, there are clubs who would favor some players over others because of their political affiliation. Additionally, F5 noted that sometimes, getting caught in politics is inevitable for players and might have dire consequences. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Players, and good players, get caught in that wildfire battle of politics. Some players get kicked off a team. Fans intervene if a player ends up giving his opinion on a political party that contrasts his team’s belief.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To gain fans, some players choose not to reveal their political affiliation, and in some cases, clubs might even ask them to remain politically and religiously neutral in order to maintain a good reputation and avoid trouble.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> RQ2: How does an interplay trichotomy exist in relation to sport opinion leaders, teams and fans?  </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fans: Voice or Voiceless</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The vast majority of fan participants (65%) stated that they do not fear voicing their opinions to religious leaders and political figures who are affiliated with their favorite team.  However, 50% would feel silenced by them if they offered financial assistance to their teams.  Similarly, participants also prefer not to voice their opinions (43%) if it contradicts with the owners of the team and continue supporting the team; the rest of the participants were neutral. Finally, 62.3% of respondents claimed that they have a high sense of solidarity with the team they support no matter what. </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fans as Opinion Leaders or Followers </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With respect to fans’ attitudes towards voicing their own opinions and in relation to the Spiral of Silence, the fan participants (65%) claimed that they are often asked about their opinions regarding the games and believe that they can influence other fans (58%), while 14% did not believe they could, and 28% were neutral. Likewise, approximately half of the participants expressed their opinions on social media and did not hold back, while 19% hesitated and 31% preferred to remain neutral.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Interview results from the closed-ended question portion of the interview show that players view themselves as influencers when it comes to decisions regarding their teams. For example, 70% either agreed or strongly agreed to the fact that they can influence decisions in their areas. Moreover, only 20% do not believe that they have access to information that they need. Finally, 60% disagree or strongly disagree with the statement that highlights their absence of involvement in politics, or as the statement says, “in what the government does.” They believe that they can express their opinions towards governmental decisions. However, when it comes to getting involved in specific issues that matter, there were no significant results due either mixed opinions (f) or their refusal to reply to the statement (g). In the former statement, 50% believe that they cannot contribute to issues that they care about while 30% disagree. The rest 20% are either neutral or refuse to answer the question. While in the latter statement, 60% refused to reply to the statement, marking the results to be inconclusive. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the other hand, government-related statements showed accurate results. The majority of the interviewees do not trust the government altogether. For instance, 80% agreed or strongly agreed that politicians are not capable of telling the truth, and 70% agreed that politicians do not involve themselves with important matters. Only 10% agreed that the government strives to do what is right. While these are general viewpoints regarding the attitudes of players towards the government, the results here are significant in a sense because they relate to the perception of players to politics. This is related to the fact that many of the government positions in Lebanon are occupied by its main political parties that usually interfere in different areas including sports.</span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Communication with Fans</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Questions 4 and 5 were directly related to fans. Question 4 was focused on the means of communications. Most of the interviewees stated that they connect with their fans via social media platforms. Some others stated that they were also ready to connect with fans on a personal basis, including but not limited to during practices, after games, and in public spaces (restaurants, streets, and cafes). None of the interviewees denied communication. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The extent of communication and its impact were discussed in question 5. All respondents agreed that as team members, they can influence their fans in general, except for F4, who stated that he can only encourage fans to do what is right. All expressed their concern about fans’ behavior during games and how it was important for them to be on their best behavior during and after games. The characteristics mentioned across the interviews related to this question included being respectful, ethical, tolerant, fair, civilized, supportive, humble, and sportsmanlike. They also conveyed their desire to have fans that cheer for the team rather than the political party or religion the team is affiliated with and avoid trouble. Many of the interviewees also deemed themselves partly responsible for their fans’ behavior. They considered themselves as potential role models for the fans, and therefore, their behavior should also be exemplary and reflect positively to the fans.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In some of the interviews, some players recalled certain events that influenced fans. For example, B1 stated that he “once </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">asked fans of [his] club to stop chanting certain derogatory terms to a specific group, and they accepted and never did it again.” Also, B5 mentioned that he had on many occasions influenced his fans: “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I do have the ability to influence our fans because fans need guidance and whichever way you guide them, they will react upon that.” The results show all players have effective ways to communicate and are mostly able to influence their fans to behave in a more respectful and sportsmanlike manner.</span><b><i>  </i></b></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Owners as Opinion Leaders or Followers</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The following summarizes the communication methods used by the opinion leaders and how they share their thoughts to followers. More than 64% of the respondents stated that the owners of the team that they supported hold media conferences or releases to announce their opinions, and 50% stated that the owners are usually active on social media, communicate with their fans, and have a strong influence on the fans. However, only 26% stated that they follow what the owners ask them to do while 43% disagreed with this, 30% neither agree nor disagree with this statement. Thirty-three percent of fans admitted to replying to owners’ comments, 27% preferred not to reply at all while 40% were neutral.      </span><b><br/> </b></p><h4><b>Discussion</b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Integration of Politics and Religion in Sports</span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Religious Impact on or Religious Devotion to the Game</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The results of this study show that the political parties in Lebanon are supported by their corresponding religious sects. It then follows that to understand the game, one must understand its people (Montague 2008).  For Lebanon, it is hardly surprising that religion and politics become intricately intertwined within and across both communities and states in the region (Maliks 2018). This was confirmed in the results, as a clear link was established between the political and the religious affiliations especially in the Muslim community where the majority of  Suuni Muslims support the Future Movement while the Shia Muslims are affiliated with the Hezbollah party and respective teams. These seemingly transparent diverse representations and/or boundaries present in the sport are governed by their corresponding political party to maintain political security and balance (Faour 2007).  This interrelatedness of sports, religion, and politics in Lebanon creates a chain reaction effect; if sports are influenced by one then it must be influenced by the other and similarly if anything impacts politics then the sport (team, fans) too is impacted.  Nassif and Amara’s (2015) research show that the over-representation of religious and political communities in the sports industry is inevitably existent in sports.  Likewise, Karami (2013) lists important basketball teams, such as Sagesse and Riyadi, and links them to their corresponding political parties, Lebanese Forces (Christian) and Future Movement (Muslim), respectively. He discusses that politics and sectarianism have damaged basketball in Lebanon since this was reflected in a prospective ban of the Lebanese Basketball Association from being a member of FIBA.  Similarly, when it comes to football, the intervention of politics in sports is consequential. In their interview, F2 and F3 pointed out how the interference might result in a FIFA ban, similar to the one that occurred in Kuwait. A similar occurrence took place in Egypt, where the politicization of the Ultras caused a football ban by FIFA (Ennarah 2017).  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Belonging to a political party is not a determinant of religious affiliation.  Many of the respondents claimed to be independent however identified themselves as part of a religious group, and few claimed that they are non-religious (e.g., atheist, agnostic etc.).  Yet, since many of the politically independent participants were still affiliated religiously as the results suggest, there is a probability that their choice of team support is linked to that of religion rather than politics.  This could also relate to the mistrust in politics but not in religion in general.  As the majority of respondents indicated one’s religion affects one’s team choice (e.g., Maronite Christians selecting to support Saggesse, Muslim fans selecting Riyadi).  Based on the numbers, there was more loyalty to religion than politics, and this could be due to the increase in the number of independents and the ongoing corruption in politics that many of the youth in Lebanon are recognizing.  </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Perception of Politics and Religion on Sports by the Fans and Players </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The impact of politics and religion on sports was mostly seen negatively, especially among the fans. On the other hand, while all interviewees pointed out the negative impacts, some also considered some of the positive outcomes of this intervention such as the budget.  This is the case for the players, as the interviewees indicated, because the world of sports is rarely considered a domain of importance in Lebanon and building a career in the sports industry is often discouraged.  Many teams, as a result, resort to politics to secure a budget. Likewise, political candidates resort to sponsoring a team to gain popularity among the people, and this has helped with the advancement of sports. Due to the lack of budget within a sports team, funding has become a necessity no matter the means (Nassif 2010).   </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, it was acknowledged by the interviewees that political intervention can damage sportsmanship, decrease the productivity of teammates, open doors for discrimination of players, and affect the overall atmosphere of the games, where winning a game can be represented with a symbolic victory of a certain political party or religious sect. These types of political conflicts represented within the teams can promote conflict between the fans (Karami 2013).  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While politics can encourage an increase in the number of fans, as results suggest, so can religion.  However, violence can also spark as a result of religious and political tension between the fans of the teams (Maugendre 2018). This can be seen during games when fans of one team can get physically and verbally violent toward the fans of another.   </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matches between Homentmen and  Riyadi, for example, have become increasingly popular  since they are often a venue for political and religious clashes. This was exacerbated by the fact that the former advanced to a higher rank due to the financial support it began receiving from an Armenian sponsor, Guy Manoukian (Naharnet Newsdesk 2018). The fans usually get heated up in these matches, which either take place in Aghpalian Club (Home Stadium for Homentmen) or the Riyadi Stadium (Manara). The political and religious tensions between the fans are often highlighted during those games, especially due to the former’s affiliation to the Tashnag Armenian party and their zealous campaign against the Turks for the recognition of and reparations for the Armenian Genocide, and the latter’s alliance with the Turkish government (MTV 2017). The games, on multiple occasions, have turned into verbal, emotional, and physical disturbances as Riyadi fans tend to provoke Homentmen fans by raising and waving the flags of Turkey in the stadium and cause violent physical clashes among the fans (MTV 2017).  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At these games, aggressive rivalry dominates the sports arena, and as shown in the Facebook post below with the caption “It is not a story of commission nor trophy nor triumph. Our passion is Al Riyadi, a passion since childhood (sic).” The extreme loyalty is evident in the picture as Riyadi fans, who most likely belong to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Al Mostakbal</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (Future Movement) political party, are Sunni Muslim.</span></p><p><b>Figure 3:</b></p><p><img alt="""" class=""alignnone wp-image-7911 aligncenter"" data-lazy-sizes=""(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px"" data-lazy-src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM-300x245.png"" data-lazy-srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM-300x245.png 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM-1024x835.png 1024w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM-768x627.png 768w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM-1536x1253.png 1536w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM.png 1640w"" height=""298"" src=""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20365%20298'%3E%3C/svg%3E"" width=""365""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""alignnone wp-image-7911 aligncenter"" height=""298"" sizes=""(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px"" src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM-300x245.png"" srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM-300x245.png 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM-1024x835.png 1024w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM-768x627.png 768w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM-1536x1253.png 1536w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-18-at-5.30.38-PM.png 1640w"" width=""365""/></noscript></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A Facebook Post of a Riyadi Fan during a Homentmen vs. Riyadi Game</span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Turkish flag they are carrying has multiple connotations. On one hand, it represents their support of Turkey, since their affiliated political party has a strong alliance with the country. On the other hand, the Turkish flag is insulting to Homentmen fans, who belong to the Tashnag party and are of Armenian origin. This Armenian-Turkish rivalry dates back to the times of the 1915 genocide, and relations between them are severed and personal. Even today, any association with Turkey is intolerable and sensitive to most members of the Armenian community. The Turkish flag, therefore, carried by Riyadi fans, is only a means to provoke Tashnag Armenian flags and challenge their identity. An attack on the player, team, political party, or religious sect is an attack on the identity of the fan, an identity that fans most often seek to protect no matter the cost.   </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Opinion Leaders, Team, and Fans: An Interplay Trichotomy</span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Opinion Leaders’ Influence on Followers </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This study has shown that the majority of the owners influence their followers on social media and occasionally announce their opinions and guide the fan base. However, only a quarter of participants emphasized that they agree with statements, and a slightly higher percentage of fans admitted to avoiding replying to comments and remaining neutral to avoid conflict. Most of the neutral answers were confined to questions concerning vocalizing opinions on social media or disagreeing with opinion leaders. Also, and surprisingly, many fans replied with “neutral” when asked about who funds their favorite team. Whether the reason is their lack of knowledge, fear, or preference not to reply remains unclear. This shows how opinion leaders remain a source of influence, on some issues, for the fans and indirectly govern their behavior or at least manage unwanted reactions.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the other hand, fans do not want to increase conflict for their teams and thus remain neutral or at times confirm the sentiments of the opinion leaders.  Some fans seem to be driven by the system as they do not prefer to be involved in the decision-making process and rather prefer to enjoy the game as fans and not deal with the bureaucracy of it. Moreover, respondents claimed that although access to social media can make opinions more accepted, the greater power resides in the hands of those who have more access to media outlets/platforms, who can make their opinions dominant and accepted by the majority, especially when providing seemingly valuable content.  </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Slight Paradox Shift </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is worth noting that owners value their business (their club). That being said, especially with the crises in Lebanon, the club is a priority to fund so that would naturally mean that they would accept funding from various sources, even if they do not prescribe to the same political or religious affiliations. However, opportunities of that sort are rare or do not tend to present themselves, unless the sponsor is affiliated.  This was the case with Guy Manoukian, who is a Lebanese-Armenian musician who financially supports the Lebanese Armenian team (Homenetmen) as opposed to any other Lebanese team (</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Naharnet</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> 2018).  The teams get external sponsors, like Manoukian, and are not funded by the actual political party the team is affiliated to, nonetheless the political connection remains, more so with the fans than the players or owners – resulting in this paradox.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Also, if owners perceive the club as their business, they would be more likely to recruit the ‘best’ players for their team and that too means recruitment across political and religious affiliations. An example of this, and an exception to the aforementioned arguments, is the current change with the teams that have been mentioned throughout the paper as predominately Christian (Sagesse) and the Muslim (Riyadi).  The captain of the Sagesse team is Ali Mezher a Shia Muslim, and the captain of Riyadi is Jean Abdelnour who is Christian (Lebanese Forces) (LBF 2022) – another paradox relating to the players. </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Team Players Influencing Decision Making and Fans </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The results showed that most team players view themselves as valuable members of the team; however, they did not deny the occasional pressure that might arise from the administration. This is in accordance with Nassif and Amara (2015) who stated that the hiring process of both administration and team can be biased towards those who support the political agenda. In the case of the Lebanese league, religious and political considerations can be integrated into the selection process, but many team members that were interviewed denied any political connection and stated that they were content in their team and were involved in the decision-making process.  Players do not try to claim affiliations because they often get recruited from one team to another, and  thus want to widen their opportunities.   </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Teammates believe that they can influence decisions made in the team.  Research shows that many sports teams in Lebanon are funded by certain political figures or parties, and this creates a complex club-team-fan dynamic (Nassif and Amara 2015).  Needing the sponsorship and the funds, teams sometimes tend to accept or overlook certain decisions made by owners, and even if some do not agree with the decisions, they tend to continue supporting them. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This influence in decision making can also be the result of the incompetence of decision-making members. As previously stated, around 90% of the team organizers are considered unqualified for the positions they are in and were only selected because of their political or religious affiliation (Nassif and Amara 2015), this creates an antagonistic perspective of the club management from both the fans and teams perspective, especially if the fan is independent (not belonging to the team’s political party). The interviewees also pointed this out, and some considered that this has also affected the hiring process.  Although the majority of the interviewees claimed that they were not politically affiliated, they stated that most of their team members belong to the political party and/or religion the club is affiliated with and probably have more influence in the decision-making process. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Moreover, the players emphasized their influence on the fans in general. All players stated that they may influence the way that their fans behave in and outside of the  arena. Most players even considered themselves as strong influencers and do not entertain foul behavior from the fans. As a result, many of the players consider themselves potential opinion leaders capable of influencing the public, particularly their fans. </span></p><p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fans: Leaders and Influencers </span></i></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The results of this study showed that more than half of the fans believe that their opinions regarding games matter and are also able to influence other fans. In relation to the Two-Step Flow theory, some fans consider themselves opinion leaders in relation to the other fans. Many of the fan respondents consider themselves as potential leaders capable of affecting other fans.  In the trichotomy, fans in numbers are the majority, however in decision making and power, they are the minority. Minority groups can become opinion leaders if they believe they can make a difference or are capable and have the means (e.g., social media platforms) to share their opinions (Bastos et al. 2013); as was the case with the fan participants who believe that they can influence their teams.  Perhaps then being fans of major sports teams creates a force to speak up and/or challenge authority, or even how sports (e.g., football) has the potential to be a cultural tool that can change the social order (Dorsey 2016). Even though sports in Lebanon are influenced by politics and religion, many of the fans believe that they can influence the team and that their opinion matters. This could be due to the spread of social media platforms that encourage freedom of expression.  Also, it can potentially be attributed to a younger generation of fans who are willing to freely express their thoughts and challenge the status quo.  Yet, it might also be that their opinions are already synced with and/or invested in the political parties involved and thus feel as if they have a sense of power to speak up and contribute to the team, hence the interplay trichotomy.   </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, this interplay is dynamic, and fans feel that they prefer not to voice their opinions when a matter could endanger the overall wellbeing of the political party, especially if that political party is funding the team, hence the Spiral of Silence effect. Fans do not deny the influence of owners and political leaders on mass opinion but deny the fact that they are silenced. This does not mean though that they would not voice their loyalty to the team. There are several  reasons this may be the case. Many of the fans consider themselves extremely loyal to the political party they belong to, and even in the sports sector, they tend not to express their opinions since they do not want to upset their political leaders (again especially when they are team sponsors) or the mass opinion. This Spiral of Silence effect in which fans, depending on their level of belonging to a certain political party or religious sect, would hesitate to share any form of opinion on social media fearing criticism and isolation from other devoted fans. This too is in line with the Two-Step Flow theory, which posits that depending on a person’s perceived level of prominence (e.g., the higher the level of belonging the greater the support and power) others will then choose to follow in the same direction.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since this study was aimed at fans who would be influenced by others on social media rather than in a physical setting, it is perhaps easier to avoid providing opinions online when the comments they might be receiving are hostile while in a supposedly friendly environment (i.e. social media team page). However, the fact that they refuse to be silenced could be a pride issue as most stated that they tend not to give their opinions if it contrasts the majority view. This does not deny the presence of a power struggle but also seems not to accept full affiliation to the opinions of owners.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fans might not psychologically accept the fact that they are fully governed by a higher political body and might want to assert individual thinking and autonomy. This perspective allows the individual to have a sense of freedom; a feeling that they can separate their passion for the sport from their political ideologies.  Also, since the discussions are usually put forward on social media, many participants would want to display their loyalty to their team, and as the results indicated, 65% of participants would be ready to voice their opinions against political and religious figures. Perhaps only those who are particularly confident and those who are independent in thought might express their opinions more freely.  Needless to say, many have lost trust in the government all together.</span></p><h4><strong>Limitations</strong></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are several limitations to this study. One of the major limitations was time constraint and the global situation (e.g., COVID-19). Because of the pandemic, the interviews could not be conducted face to face, so most of them were done through Skype and Whatsapp. What complicated data collection was that some interviewees refused to answer certain questions, and this did not allow the interviewer to have substantial content for some questions. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sample representation and size were also an issue due to the limited time and religious affiliation. The respondents were mostly Shia Muslim, which did not provide an equal demographic distribution. This was also due to the fact that many sports platforms, which belonged to different political/religious affiliations, refused to post the questionnaire on their sports pages. </span></p><h4><strong>Implications and Future Research</strong></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This study examined the inevitable influence of politics and religion on sports in Lebanon. The results clearly indicated how both fans and players were fully affected by this phenomenon, and while team independence was highlighted in certain cases and most were looking forward to having this interference removed, it was clear that this influence will continue in sports since the issue of finance still stands, especially after the economic crises in Lebanon. This study has highlighted the attitude of both fans and players regarding the integration of politics in sports and has shed light on both the negative and positive aspects of this integration. Also, the different attitudes of fans towards loyalty to political parties and religious sects and their connection to the respective teams were a novel point in the study. Interestingly, the slight difference in attitude between basketball and football is also a key finding from this study as the rise in popularity of basketball due to increased funding is viewed favorably by fans and players regardless of political affiliation. The results of this research, however, could inspire future complementary research. For example, research should be done comparing the situation of men's teams versus women's teams.   </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Finally, to tackle the issue of political and religious interference in Lebanon, it is crucial to introduce laws that do not allow the interference of politics and religion in sports by managing the source of funding the team receives and ensuring that each team includes people of all religions and minorities. This can also allow fans to make their decisions based on the qualifications of the teams and their players rather than the club’s political or religious affiliation. This might be difficult to achieve, considering the context of Lebanon, but it is not impossible. The teams can ask for financial help from organizations/companies/institutions that do not have any political or religious affiliation. Also, monitoring players, fans, coaches, and administration from clubs help in keeping the political and religious tension at bay. Finally, raising awareness by organizing campaigns can also be a small yet positive step towards achieve political and religious segregation from sports. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is no doubt that politics and religion play a major role in sports in Lebanon. Many fans and players are caught between the tumultuous political battles that subtly reflected in the administration of clubs and games. It is safe to assume that the involvement of politics and religion in Lebanon’s many fields, including that of sports, is a complicated matter and will need years to resolve.</span></p><p> </p></div><div class=""clear""></div></div> <script type=""application/ld+json"">{""@context"":""http:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""NewsArticle"",""dateCreated"":""2022-10-01T21:18:35+00:00"",""datePublished"":""2022-10-01T21:18:35+00:00"",""dateModified"":""2022-10-08T18:33:29+00:00"",""headline"":""The Integration of Politics and Sports in Lebanon"",""name"":""The Integration of Politics and Sports in Lebanon"",""keywords"":""basketball,Football,Lebanon,Politics,Religion,Spiral of Silence theory,Sports,Two-Step flow theory"",""url"":""https:\/\/www.arabmediasociety.com\/the-integration-of-politics-and-sports-in-lebanon\/"",""description"":""Abstract In Lebanon, sports have been heavily linked to politics and religion.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of politics on Lebanese sports in the two most prominent sports fields, football and basketball, using the Spiral of Silence and the Two-Step theories investigated through a mixed methods approach (survey: fan participants, and interviews: professional players). Results showed that politics and religion play a major role in sports, especially through funding, and fans are affected by this former integration.\u00a0 Results also indicated mostly negative attitudes towards this interference, and many have noted being affected by opinions related to teams and decisions that circulate on social media. The results pave the way to understanding how the sports-religion system intertwines in Lebanon, provides an assessment of fans\u2019 and players\u2019 behavior, and emphasizes the need for financial support for the teams\u2019 and fans\u2019 sustainability, as a recommendation to reduce this interference in a healthy manner.\r\nIntroduction\r\nFrom the ancient times of the Roman Colosseum to the present times of Yankee Stadium, the Super Bowl, and the Olympics, sports have played a pivotal role in societies across the globe. Taking into consideration that there is a lot at stake including power, money, as well as pride, sports is heavily linked with politics (Dunning 2013). In Lebanon, the case is not different. In fact, both religion and politics influence sports (Nassif and Amara 2015). In Lebanon, the major political parties have distinct religious affiliations and are tied to their own sports teams (Nassif and Amara 2015). The Future Movement political party is predominantly associated with Sunni Muslims and the Al Riyadi team in basketball and Al Ansar team in football (Reiche 2011) Likewise, the Lebanese Forces, another Lebanese political party mainly associated with Christians is a supporter of Sagesse basketball team (Najjar 2017). Similarly, the Progressive Socialist Party is predominantly Druze and is associated with Al-Safa football team (Reiche 2011). These are a few examples of teams and their political affiliations; however, the greater concern lies in attempting to answer the following questions: Why is there a dominance of politics and religion in sports in Lebanon, and where did these types of divisions originate? How do they influence the Lebanese sports field?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo help answer these questions, a historical overview is needed about the Lebanese political system.\u00a0 By the end of WWI, Lebanon was under French mandate upon the partition of the Ottoman Empire, and it was the sub-unit of the French authority for Syria and Lebanon and managed from Damascus (Traboulsi 2012).\u00a0 Even after independence was declared, French forces continued to exert their influence (Hakim 2019). In 1943, Lebanon formed a sectarian government that distributed the seats in parliament on a ratio of six to five in favor of Christians (Minorities at Risk 2004) and it was agreed that the president of the Lebanese Republic would be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister would be Sunni Muslim, and the president of the parliament would be a Shia Muslim (Minorities at Risk 2004).\u00a0 A civil war erupted in 1975, spanning almost 30 years.\u00a0 After the war ended, the Taif Accord was ratified by parliament in 1989 with the aim of \u201ceradicating political sectarianism\u201d as an essential national objective (The Taif Agreement 1989, p. 5). The Accord divided the seats of parliament equally between Christians and Muslims while also transferring much of the authority of the president to the cabinet (The Taif Agreement, 1989).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe succeeding foreign powers that occupied the nation and a large group of people with various religious communities that have coexisted inside Lebanon have not just contributed to the development of a modern state that revels in very rich cultural and religious diversities but also established a republic administered by a delicate balance of power (Salibi 1993).\u00a0 This delicate balance, based on religious division or distribution, has permeated itself into different forms and discourses in the country, including but not limited to geopolitics, education, media, and sports.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis study attempts to identify how this integration influences the sports industry, with a specific focus on basketball and football. This is necessary to determine the ways in which these different sports can grow and develop. Lebanon offers a thought-provoking perspective on the study of sport and politics. While previous literature has looked into politics and religion in sports in Lebanon, no study has tackled this integration in detail, particularly taking into consideration fan attitude and behavior. This study is valuable in that it bridges that gap as it describes this integration in relation to the fans of basketball and football teams in Lebanon.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile the influence of politics on sports is obvious, the objective of this study is to investigate the details of this influence on football and basketball and its effect on fans and their opinion making process.\u00a0 In doing so, the Spiral of Silence theory was used to investigate whether political figures and\/or religious leaders impose a direct or indirect Spiral of Silence effect on the team and fans, given that the political\/religious leader is the owner of the team or has strong political affiliations with certain political parties who sponsor (give financial help) those teams.\u00a0 From this perspective, this study will try to understand whether the teams and fans avoid expressing their actual opinions in fear of losing the support of the religious\/political figures who offer financial assistance to the team. In investigating these intertwined perspectives, the researchers will be able to also understand, through the Two-Step Flow model, whether the opinion leaders (e.g., politicians\/sponsors\/owners of the teams, or teams\/players) transfer their thoughts to the followers (e.g., teams\/players, fans) on how to behave concerning football and basketball and at which point one (owners, teams\/players, fans)\u00a0 becomes the opinion leader or the follower.\u00a0 These types of connections are vital in aiming at offering solutions to combat political and religious power over sports.\u00a0 In doing so, a sample consisting of sports fans were recruited to participate in a survey assessing the aforementioned concepts. In addition, qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with football and basketball players to understand these relationships from a team player\u2019s perspective.\u00a0 The methods are triangulated to understand how politics and religion influence and integrate with sports in Lebanon, mainly in basketball and football, as well as how the fans of these sports are impacted by this politics\/religion sports relationship.\u00a0\r\nLiterature Review\r\nThe integration of politics in sports is not only exclusive to Lebanon but is a worldwide phenomenon and can be seen in Middle Eastern countries (e.g., Egypt) and European (e.g., Spain, UK\u2026).\u00a0 In 2007, the football fans in Egypt started organizing demonstrations against the government under the global and official banner of the Ultra-actions, statements and actions taken by the Ultras (Ennarah 2017).\u00a0 They used their fandom as a means to vocalize about various political and social issues in the country, and the events of the 2011 Arab Spring further politicized the Ultras and transformed them into revolutionary figures (Ennarah 2017).\u00a0 However, there were consequences to their efforts, such as stigmatization and eventually the government banning fans from attending football matches in stadiums, leading the team to lose their main space for expression (Ennarah 2017).\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the European context, La Liga (Spanish League) is considered as one of the most popular football leagues around the world; this is clearly indicated in the annual revenue of 4.479 billion euros in 2017-2018 (Casinellie 2019).\u00a0 However, Spain is home to one of the biggest political rivalries in sports, and that is evident between Real Madrid and Barcelona with the political tension between these two teams dating back to historical events (Wallace 2013).\u00a0 Real Madrid is known to be supported by the government and are therefore excused from paying taxes while Barcelona, being Catalonian, is required to pay high taxes to the government (Wallace, 2013). The latest political clash between the two teams occurred in November 2019 when the match was postponed due to protests in Catalonia (Vakulenko 2013). Fans were protesting the arrest of certain political figures that support the Catalonian doctrine. Moreover, during national games, there had been several clashes between the players from both teams, and this affected the overall tone of future games (Vakulenko 2013).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile the rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid has a different historical context, the interference of politics in the world of sports is clearly highlighted in the events, which makes the essence of this rivalry similar to Lebanon. This demonstrates that integration of sports and politics is phenomenon that occurs in different parts of the world.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nLikewise, the Scottish experience of football is fierce, intense, and embedded in deep political and religious representations. Even after hundreds of years, the Catholic-Protestant rivalry is portrayed through football between the Celtics, founded in 1887 by a Catholic brother, and the Rangers, founded in 1972, which became a team of the Scottish Protestant working class (PA Team, 2018).\u00a0 While the teams were professional and peaceful in the beginning, they soon became fierce rivals as both clubs and their fans vocalized their identities in direct opposition, with \u201cCeltics being associated with socialism and Irish Republicanism while Rangers with conservatism and Northern Irish unionism\u201d (PA Team 2018, para. 10).\u00a0\r\n\r\nDuring the games, the intensity of the rivalry is portrayed through political chants (Celtics chanting the IRA anthem to vocalize their desire to separate from the UK; Rangers chanting sectarian rife in the Ibrox or Parkhead stands), raising of flags, and in some cases, violence (Farah 2017). As Farah (2017) bluntly states, \u201ca Celtic win is a victory for Catholicism and nationalism, while a Rangers victory is another step forward for the unionists and the Protestants\u201d (para. 12).\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe heated rivalry and the events that often take place are not strange in Lebanon, and are embedded in political and religious undertones. With fans also chanting political slogans or raising party flags, with the occasional physical altercation between opposing teams. The situation in both European as well as Middle Eastern countries shows how embedded the concept of politics and sports is, and this study will examine these possible tensions in Lebanon.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nContext of Lebanon and Lebanese Sports\u00a0\r\nLebanon is a country that has more than 18 religious sects. Since the formation of Lebanon, many political parties have formed. In fact, many of them who participated in the Civil War in 1975 still exist today, and they are active members of the current government or participating members within the Lebanese parliament. The political parties each represent a certain religious sect in Lebanon.\u00a0 These politico-religious divisions have also been portrayed in sports, as each sports team is somehow a representative of one of the aforementioned political parties\/religions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSince a specific religious group occupies each geographical area in Lebanon, it seems that the common situation is to have the sports teams of this geographical area that is occupied by a specific religion support the political party that represents the religion. For example, in basketball, Al Riyade is the team of Central Beirut. Central Beirut is mainly occupied by Sunni Muslims, who are represented by the Future Movement, and therefore fans of Al Riyade Club are mostly Sunni Muslims who support the Future Movement (Yee 2019). Football and basketball are considered to be the most followed sports in Lebanon. Both basketball and football leagues have teams from different areas and date back to the early 1930s and late 1940s. The year 1933 was historical in sports history as it signaled the birth of the Lebanese Football Association (Hawi 2009). This paved the way to official leagues.\u00a0 For basketball, although teams have been around since the 1920s, the governing body, the Lebanese Basketball Federation was founded in 1947 (LBF 2021), however it was not until the 1992-1993 season that teams competed once again after the Lebanese civil war.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn football, The Classico, the game between Ansar and Nejmeh attracts the most fans and is considered the highlight event of the season. This match is usually played in the Camille Chamoun Stadium (known as Madine Reyadiyeh or literally Sports City). The stadium has 45,000 seats, and during such matches (prior to Covid-19), the stadium welcomes the audience in full capacity. Most of the fans prefer to physically attend the match because it is in the heart of Beirut and very close to the areas where the fans reside (Maugendre 2018). The rest would be watching from cafes or homes. Other matches that strike an interest to the fans are games between Nejmeh and Alahed due to hidden political tensions that spark a competitive status from the teams as they are represented by Haraket Amal (Hope Movement) and Hezbollah respectively, both from the Shia Muslim sect (Maugendre 2018).\r\n\r\nBasketball leagues have recently climbed up the ranks as one of the most-watched sports in Lebanon, especially in the last decade (Sharif 2017). One of the most popular matches in the numerous seasons is those between Sagesse and Riyadi, which are considered to be the most successful teams in the history of Lebanese basketball. These matches take place in either Manara (home stadium of Riyadi) or Ghazir (home stadium of Sagesse). The stadiums for these matches are usually full with more than 7,500 fans present.\u00a0 All matches are publicized via different media channels and have high viewership ratings (Ipsos 2017).\u00a0\r\nTable 1\r\nFootball Teams in Lebanon and their Affiliations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootball Team\r\nPolitical Affiliation\r\nReligious Affiliation\r\nOwner\r\nNumber of fans\r\n\r\n\r\nAlAhed\r\nHezbollah\r\nShia Muslim\r\nTamim Solayman\r\n8,400\r\n\r\n\r\nNejmeh\u00a0\r\nTayyar Al Mostakbal (Future Movement \u2013 ownership); Fans: Muslim Shia Amal Movement, Hezbollah\r\nSunni\/Shia Muslim\u00a0\r\nAsaad Sakal\r\n129,000\r\n\r\n\r\nShabab Alsahel\r\nX\r\nShia Muslim\u00a0\r\nSamir Dbouk\r\n18,000\r\n\r\n\r\nTadamon Sour\r\nHaraket Amal (Amal\/Hope Movement)\r\nShia Muslim\r\nSamir Baweb\r\n13,000\r\n\r\n\r\nAnsar\u00a0\r\nTayyar Mostakbal (Future Movement)\r\nSunni Muslim\r\nNabil Bader\r\n10,000\r\n\r\n\r\nTripoli\u00a0\r\nNajib Mikatti\u00a0\r\nSunni Muslim\r\nGhassan Yakan\u00a0\r\n13,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 2\r\nBasketball Teams in Lebanon and their Affiliations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasketball Team)\u00a0\r\nPolitical Affiliation\r\nReligious Affiliation\r\nOwner\r\nNumber of fans\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nRiyadi\u00a0\r\nTayyar Al Mostakbal (Future Movement)\r\nSunni Muslim\u00a0\r\nMazen Tabarra\r\n165,000\r\n\r\n\r\nChampville\r\nTayyar Alwatani (Free Patriotic Movement)\r\nMaronite Christian\u00a0\r\nAkram Safa\u00a0\r\n12,300\r\n\r\n\r\nSagesse\r\nOuwet Al Lebnaniye (Lebanese Forces)\r\nMaronite Christian\u00a0\r\nElie Yahchouchi\r\n61,000\r\n\r\n\r\nMoutahed\r\nMohammad Al Safadi\r\nSunni Muslim\r\nAhmad AlSafadi\r\n12,000\r\n\r\n\r\nHoops\r\nAl Bath\r\nShia Muslim\r\nJasem Kansou\r\n4,500\r\n\r\n\r\nByblos\r\nX\r\nChristian\u00a0\r\nJohn Khaled\r\n7,700\r\n\r\n\r\nHomentmen\u00a0\r\nTachnak (Armenian Revolutionary Federation)\r\nArmenian Orthodox Christian\u00a0\r\nRafi Mometechilian\r\n33,000\r\n\r\n\r\nBeirut\r\nNA\r\nChristian\r\nNader Hakim\r\n69,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSports Culture in Lebanon\u00a0\r\nIn Lebanon, football and basketball are considered the two most popular sports in the country (Sharif 2017). Many of the teams, whether in football or basketball, have reached a degree of fame that has attracted many fans and some of the teams have also gained international recognition (Sharif 2017) As a result, fans (as seen in the tables above) have become invested in these sports and have followed them and attended many of their games.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPresence of Sports Federations\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Lebanese Basketball Federation and the Lebanese Football Association are presided over by Akram Halabi (Maronite Christian) and Hachem Haidar (Shia Muslim), respectively, and divided based on political and religious agendas (Lebanese Basketball Federation 2022; Lebanese Football Association 2022). The federations include members from all the religions, but the main decisions are usually taken by the presidents and general secretaries (Nassif personal communication, June 6, 2020).\u00a0\r\n\r\nFootball and Basketball Funding\r\n\r\nFootball is considered the most popular sports in Lebanon, and for years, no other sport was able to outshine its popularity (Reiche 2011; Sharif 2017). However, in the past years, basketball has started gaining popularity in Lebanon, and today, the number of followers has increased and almost surpassed that of football (Sharif 2017). This is due to the investment and the enormous financial support from businesspersons, sponsors, and banks that it has been receiving compared to football (Sharif 2017). Still, in most cases, the financial support has come with underlying political agendas. However, the result of this support was the drastic increase in the number of spectators during games over the course of the last few years (Attieh personal communication, June 5, 2020).\u00a0\r\nImpact of Politics on Sports\u00a0\r\nNassif and Amara (2015) conducted a research study on sports, policy, and politics in Lebanon. According to the authors, the over-representation of religious communities in the sports industry within the nation to the detriment of developing a clear and functional structure is strongly existent in the national sport movement. In other words, there is a clear political and religious representation, whether regarding ownership, management, and\/or team members, in each sports club or academy, and in the political and religious affiliation of the fans that support it. However, the type of impact and the extent to which the members involved (e.g., team players, fans, owners) affect the other is not clear. The national sport movement encompasses the numerous fans and spectators in the country that are in support of the various sports played. Numerous individuals within the sports industry end up landing in positions within certain federations since they are supported by a political party (Nassif and Amara 2015). The study indicated that 90% of the individuals working in sports organizations are not qualified for their jobs and were recruited because of political considerations (Nassif and Amara 2015). This only further proves the manifestation of politics and religion in the sports industry as an indirect form of power struggle.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nNassif (2014) indicates that there is a great deal of corruption in the nation\u2019s sports industry as a result of the meddling and intrusion by the political figures in the club administrations; thus, politicization of sports in Lebanon has been unavoidable. Political influence is predominantly linked to the administrators and fans and less so for the players (Nassif 2014). The Lebanese sports industry is becoming a sector where there is constant clashing between political parties, thereby going against the actual objectives of sports which are meant to unite people, bring them closer, and generate happiness and entertainment (Rieche 2011). The objectives are, instead, being replaced with hatred, division, and aggressive competition; especially in a country in where politics cannot be separated from religion due to the structure of the Lebanese system (in reference to the Taif Accord).\r\n\r\nThe lack of transparency in the funding system and nepotism were common in this sector and lack of transparency in allocation of money to associations and different federations were expected (Rice et al. 1952).\u00a0 Perhaps then, one of the main reasons Lebanon was not able to disentangle the involvement of politics in sports is the vital need for a financial sponsor or supporter, and when it comes to funding, a price is always paid.\u00a0\r\nTheoretical Framework\u00a0\u00a0\r\nTo further understand the influence of political and religious figures as club representatives and\/or funders of the players and fans, the Spiral of Silence and the Two-Step Flow model are used. These theories are used to help determine the degree (e.g., Two-Step Flow) and independence of vocalization (e.g., Spiral of Silence) of opinions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSpiral of Silence Theory\r\n\r\nThe Spiral of Silence theoretical framework was chosen for this study to account for the fact that sports fans might have herd mentality, moving with the crowd, or whose points of view, although dissimilar sometimes, might choose to conform to the overall trend of perspectives that link politics and religion to conditional fandom and support.\u00a0 It is important to note that the Spiral of Silence is about people who conform to the opinion of the majority in fear of isolation (Gearhart and Zhang 2015).\u00a0\r\n\r\nAccording to Neumman (1974), the more a person's opinion is backed by the majority\u2019s point of view, the greater the likelihood that they are prepared to communicate it in the public arena. Consequently, individuals who are identified to be in the minority tend to continue being silent and keep opinions to themselves owing to the fear that if they share their point of view, they will experience isolation. In the Lebanese sports context, this theory helps investigate whether the minority are able to voice their opinion about Lebanese sports teams, especially when these sports teams are controlled by a majority with specific political and religious affiliations. Furthermore, it is essential to mention that so far, no study known to the researchers on sports has utilized this theory to explain different factors related to the functionality of sports in Lebanon.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe hostile atmosphere that surrounds Lebanese politics and sports, as aforementioned in the literature review, can perhaps be linked to the fans\u2019 reactions to opinion leaders and to the opinions of other fans. As Hayes (2007) suggested, people are more likely to voice their opinion in a friendly environment than in a hostile one, thus in hostile environments people might confirm, or become silenced (e.g., not claiming a different political affiliation than the group).\u00a0\r\n\r\n If indeed political or religiously affiliated sponsors are helping the team financially then fans might not speak out about the political\/religious party or leader.\u00a0 For example, if a person (a fan) is criticizing the team, then that means they are indirectly criticizing the political party that the sports team is affiliated with, and perhaps for the same reason they might remain silent.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nTwo-Step Flow Theory\r\n\r\nThis particular theory was selected to represent the social influences that delineate the identity of the dominating opinion in every segment of the Lebanese sports community.\u00a0 It deals with the role of the mainstream media in addition to the present day's social media influence. The theory makes the argument that notions and ideas will emanate from the mainstream media to leaders who are opinionated and thereafter from opinionated leaders to the segments of the populations that are less active and are less knowledgeable (Katz 1955). An opinionated leader is delineated as a renowned individual or entity that can influence or sway public opinion on the topic, subject matter, or notion that the leader is known for.\u00a0 Often, opinionated leaders are business leaders, journalists, as well as celebrities or sports superstars. Lately, they have also included bloggers (Uzuno\u011flu and Kip 2013) as well as social media influencers. The engagement of opinions on social media known as \u201csocial percussion\u201d has a great influence on the leading opinion of the day (S\u0101mbhar 2009).\u00a0 This analogy of social percussion denotes that the leaders set the tempo, and all then march to the beat, speculating a bandwagon media effect from an active as opposed to a passive audience.\u00a0 Social media serves as a powerful social platform for the spread of mass opinion, and it is one of the objectives of the study to explore the influence of opinion leaders on fan base in sports as well as the reaction of the latter on popular opinions set by the former.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the context of sports, the Two-Step Flow communication model delineates that information flows from the media to the general public are intermediated and facilitated by opinion leaders who tend to be more exposed to media messages and who exercise personal influence on the attitudes and the opinions of others (Choi 2015). Most of the people within the Lebanese sports federations have obtained particular positions simply because they are representatives or supporters of a political party (Nassif and Amara 2015).\u00a0 This perhaps can negatively influence the further advancement of the team.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPeople tend to react to messages or opinions about matters that interest them but tend to avoid expressing their opinions about topics that might spark conflict or speak against their collective ideologies. Thus, the fans' decisions to accept or reject a given message and their values, options, and beliefs are the most important and influential elements that affect the acceptability of the theories under study.\r\n\r\nResearch Questions\r\n\r\nRQ1: What is the impact that the interrelation of politics and religion in Lebanon has on the sport (football and basketball), team, and fans?\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nRQ2:\u00a0How does an interplay trichotomy exist in relation to sport opinion leaders, teams, and fans?\u00a0\u00a0\r\nMethodology\r\nThis study makes use of mixed methods research design, which includes both quantitative (survey to understand fans attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews with team players) in order to depict the relationship between politics\/religion and sports in Lebanon.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSample and Procedure\r\n\r\nInterview\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn order to gain one-on-one insight that is comprehensive from the respondents regarding the subject matter in question, semi-structured interviews were conducted with various football and basketball players. These interviewees included ten professional players (1st division players), five football, and five basketball players from different basketball and football clubs across Lebanon. All interviewees were male except for one female (football). Due to the limited number of female football and basketball teams in Lebanon and the lack of their popularity compared to men\u2019s teams, only one female football player was interviewed to get a female\u2019s point of view and the influence of politics on women\u2019s teams. The interviewees\u2019 names are represented by letters and numbers in order to protect the privacy of the players. The basketball players were identified with the letter \u201cB\u201d along with a number while the football players were identified with the letter \u201cF\u201d along with a corresponding number in accordance with the order in which they were interviewed (example: B1 is the first player interviewed in basketball; F4 is the fourth player interviewed in football etc.).\u00a0 The fifth player of each category (basketball and football) are captains of their teams. Table 3 below specifies the player, along with their club affiliations.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nTable 3\r\nPlayer Club Affiliations (Both Football and Basketball)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayer\r\nClub Affiliation\r\nTeam Political and Religious Affiliation\r\n\r\n\r\nF1\r\nAnsar\r\n\u00a0 Future Movement\/Sunni Muslim\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nF2\r\nAl Ahed\r\nHezbollah\/Shia Muslim\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nF3\r\nNejmeh\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Future Movement\/Muslim (ownership) fans: Shia\/Sunni Muslim\r\n\r\n\r\nF4\r\nSafah\r\nProgressive Social Party\/Druz\r\n\r\n\r\nF5\r\nHoops\r\nAl Baath\/Shia Muslim\r\n\r\n\r\nB1\r\nRiyadi\r\nFuture Movement\/Sunni Muslim\r\n\r\n\r\nB2\r\nHomentmen\r\nArmenian Revolutionary Federation\/Christian Armenian Orthodox\r\n\r\n\r\nB3\r\nByblos\r\nNA\/Christian\r\n\r\n\r\nB4\r\nBeirut\r\nNA\/Christian\r\n\r\n\r\nB5\r\nHomentmen\r\nArmenian Revolutionary Federation\/Christian Armenian Orthodox\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the players were interviewed using Whatsapp or Skype. The players were individually contacted and asked for willingness and availability to participate in the interview. Most of the answers were in Arabic, so they needed to be translated.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSurvey\r\n\r\nThe survey aimed at investigating how fans from different political backgrounds behave and support specific sports teams. The questionnaire enabled the researcher to identify how politics integrates with sports and how this integration affects fans\u2019 behavior.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe sample consisted of 301 fans, out of which six were removed, resulting in a total sample of 295 respondents who support numerous teams in Lebanon and prescribe to different religions and political affiliations. Respondents were between 18 to 27 years old (M = 26.63, SD = 6.70).\u00a0 Out of the 295 respondents, 68.13% were male, and 31.86% were female.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe survey was carried out by using an online link (via Google Forms) sent out to the target population. All respondents volunteered to participate. Anonymity was ensured to minimize risk to the survey participants.\u00a0\r\n\r\nVariables\u00a0\r\n\r\nDemographics and Traits\r\n\r\nAside from age and gender, it was important for this study to ask the participants to specify their political and religious affiliation. Participants were asked to identify which sports team they are a fan of, their fan behavior (e.g., supporting the team), as well as their attitude about the sports team that they support (e.g., the best team) and if the team is affiliated with a certain political party. \u00a0\r\n\r\nPolitical and Religious Impact\r\n\r\nSurvey participants were asked a series of eight questions related to their attitudes towards the influence of politics on sports, specifically on the sports team that they are a fan of.\u00a0 These sets of statements were measured on a Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree.\u00a0 Four additional questions were asked about religion\u2019s influence on sports.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLevel of Engagement with Sports Team\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis variable measures the players\u2019 level of support to the club and dedication in both football and basketball. It also measures the fan\u2019s willingness to blindly support their team, attend games, and support the team players in victory and loss.\r\n\r\nTeam Players\u2019 Perceptions about the Club\u00a0\r\n\r\n This variable was measured by how team players view their clubs, whether they are fully engaged, and whether their level of engagement affects their behavior with their fans.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Opinion of Fans towards any Game: Two-Step Flow\r\n\r\nThe research aims to consider fans\u2019 attitudes towards games and whether owners of sports teams communicate with fans and affect their opinions, and whether fans feel their opinion matters. A total of 11 statements were used, four statements directly relating to the fan\u2019s behavior such as \u201cpeople ask my opinion about any game related to my favorite team,\u201d and seven statements relating to the fan\u2019s perceptions of the owners. All statements were measured using a Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree (Fans: \u03b1 = .800, M = 3.561 SD = .770; Owners: \u03b1 = .779, M = 3.345 SD = .570).\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nInfluence of Opinion Leaders: Spiral of Silence\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe study aims to determine the impact of opinion leaders on the mass fan base and whether their political and religious status, along with their financial investment in the team, influence the fans in either way, positively, by providing them a sense of solidarity and loyalty, or negatively, by silencing the expression of fans.\u00a0 Three statements were measured on a Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree (\u03b1 = 758, M =3.300, SD = .819).\u00a0\u00a0\r\nResults\r\nDemographic Analysis\r\n\r\nParticipants (N = 295) were asked to specify their political and religious affiliations. Politically, 44% participants stated that they were independent; 17% stated that they supported Hezbollah party, 12% Future Movement, 7% Lebanese Forces, 5% Civil Society and Amal Movement, 4% Free Patriotic Movement, and the rest of the participants were divided amongst Phalanges, Progressive Socialist Party, and those who did not answer the question (2% each). However, the majority of the respondents\u2019 religious affiliation were divided amongst Shia Muslim (46%), Maronite (20%), and Sunni Muslim (19%).\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAll of the respondents who chose Hezbollah as their affiliated political party identified themselves as Shia Muslim, while\u00a0 63% stated that they supported the Al-Ahd football team. Twenty-eight percent stated that they support other football teams whose religious affiliation is also Shia Muslim. Less than 4% support Ansar while about 6% stated that they do not support any football team. Similarly, out of the 12% who stated that they support the Future Movement (Tayyar el Moustakbal), approximately 91% were Muslim Sunna, and all support Al-Ansar football team. Moreover, out of the 23% of respondents who claimed they did not support any basketball team, 84% were Muslim Shiaa. In addition, out of the 17% who support Al-Ansar team, 94% support Al-Riyadi basketball team, which is also affiliated with the Future Movement; 91% of those are Muslim Sunna.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAmong the 61 respondents who support Sagesse, 59% are Christians (72% Maronites) and 36% are Muslims (95% of which are Shiaa). Out of 87 respondents who stated that they do not support any football team, 72% were Christians. Out of 72%, 79% were Maronites. Finally, there was a variety of football and basketball teams that the 130 politically independent respondents supported.\u00a0\r\n\r\nRQ1: What is the impact that the interrelation of politics and religion in Lebanon has on the sport (football and basketball), team, and fans?\r\n\r\nParticipants did not deny that sports in Lebanon, specifically football and basketball, are highly affected by politics and religion. The majority portrayed a more negative perspective on the influence of politics and religion on sports after stating that their favorite team is funded by political or religious groups.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPolitical Impact\r\n\r\nMore than half of the participants agreed that the team they support belongs to the political party they support, and roughly 50% stated that the political party they belong to funds the team they support. On the other hand, more than 50% of the participants who identified themselves as independent politically (44%) claimed that their favorite team is not funded by a political group. This suggests that the funding of their favorite team might come from independent donors or is funded by a religious figure or sect. While in the Lebanese context religion and politics are inseparable in most cases, there are teams funded by certain religious figures or are more known to have religious rather than political affiliations although the latter might still be interfering subtly. However, the fans might be unaware of that, and many fans tend to have a more positive attitude towards religion than politics, hence separating the former from the latter.\u00a0\r\n\r\nApproximately 73% of respondents claimed that the impact of politics on sports is not positive (disagreed or strongly disagreed), and 88% strongly agreed or agreed that politics affects sports negatively in Lebanon. Respondents agreed or strongly agreed that politics influences many factors including how a game is played (71%), how fans act (82%), how players are selected (70%), and how teams behave (75%). Also, 80% of the respondents believe that the teams are financed by political parties. However, when it comes to winning games, around 50% believe that politics interfere in the games\u2019 outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nReligious Impact\r\n\r\nMainly, 63% of respondents noted that the team they support is affiliated to the religious group they belong to or identify with.\u00a0 Eighty-six percent of Maronites do not support any football team and roughly 50% of Shia Muslims do not support any basketball team. The rest are mostly divided amongst Riyadi and Sagesse clubs.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSlightly less intense than the effect of political integration, 72% of the respondents either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the fact that religion has a positive impact on sports. While this is still a high number, the negative impact of religion on sports is less dramatic since many might regard politics as dirty while religion is considered noble. Also, 80% agreed that religion impacts the way people participate in sports, and 58% admitted that religious affiliation affects the team they select to support.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSimilar to fan responses, team members, or all interviewees, football and basketball, admit that sports in Lebanon is highly influenced mostly by politics. The majority of the players stated that religion and politics have a negative impact on sports, and many emphasized that sports should not interfere with politics. However, three interviewees, all basketball players, highlighted the positive aspects of the influence of politics for different reasons. For instance, player B3 argued that the financial support of the political parties on the clubs has a positive effect on the game in general and on the financial aspect in particular:\r\n\r\nThe integration of politics in sports helped Lebanese Basketball in two ways. The first factor is the financial support for the teams; the second factor is attracting the fans. The money factor is because of political clashes and that led to the support of these political parties to these teams.\r\n\r\nB4, on the other hand, also focused on the financial aspect but emphasized the importance of having a financial supporter of an overlooked domain in Lebanon. He views political interference \u201cin a positive way because political parties tend to support the teams financially, and this helps a lot because there are times when there are no sponsors to pay a huge amount of money [sic].\u201d Similarly, B5 also highlighted another pragmatic aspect of interference of politics:\r\n\r\nYes, I hate politics\u2019 interference with sports, but I don\u2019t really hate politicians interfering with sports as sponsors. For example, if someone wants to declare his candidacy for his next election, like why not choose a sports platform or a team as a sponsor [in order] to grab the attention of the fans\u2026That\u2019s not bad.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite their statements, like the other players, both still agreed that this interference has its unfavorable outcomes. None of the football players expressed any positive aspects regarding this interference.\u00a0 A possible explanation could be recent support that basketball has been receiving over football. Perhaps the new fame of many players is one of the possible reasons why the funding system in basketball is more welcomed than football. When asked about how politics and religion are integrated with sports in Lebanon and what the impacts of this integration are (questions 7 and 8 of the interview), the answers varied, but all pointed out the negative impact of this integration in the sports world.\r\n\r\nFootball\u00a0\r\n\r\nAll football players recognized the negative impact on sports of politics and religion in Lebanon, but there were various inputs regarding the issue. Some conveyed their belief that the impact is not that detrimental. For example, F2 and F5 both argued that while the influence is present and disadvantageous, there are ways to overcome or at least ignore its involvement. In her interview, when asked about the results of the integration, F5 stated that \u201c[she doesn\u2019t] think this [the results of the integration] is a big deal as long as it does not affect the teammates,\u201d yet did not fail to recognize how it is not often the case and how teammates can be caught in the political battle. F2 provided a more progressive interpretation of the issue. While he also recalled the damaging effects, he believes that this issue can be mended if the \u201cfans\u2019 mentality\u201d changes. F2 endorsed a more cultural and tolerant approach towards sports where political interference does not create a conflict of interest.\u00a0 At the end of the interviews, all interviewees, particularly F5 and F2, stressed the importance of removing this interference to create a better environment for both teammates and fans.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause of that [extremism], we hope these types of things go away\u2026These issues [of political and religious intervention] are rarely found abroad and that positively impacts the game over there, so I am hoping this phenomenon disappears from our games (in Lebanon).\u201d Statement by F2.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen politics gets involved, things may become dirty, and in Lebanon, it usually does. We must work to ensure that this is no longer the case.\u201d Statement by F5.\r\n\r\nBasketball\u00a0\r\n\r\nBasketball players were less determined to consider the interference of politics in Lebanon as negative. All interviewees agreed that each team is affiliated with a certain political and\/or religious group, and player B5 even provided some examples. While most of the basketball interviewees had the same opinion as football interviewees, in the case of basketball, two highlighted some positive outcomes to this integration. For instance, B3 stated: \u201cThe clash between Riyadi and Sagesse helped basketball in one way and showed in the other way the problem that was present in Lebanon between Muslims and Christians.\u201d In other words, B3 believes that the \u201ccold war\u201d between religions has been playing out on the basketball court by fans who feel that their teams, that represent a certain religion or sect, are a means to express their greivances towards the other by supporting their teams. A win for their teams means a win for their religion\/political parties. Moreover, B5 stated that while interference is negative, any financial support from political candidates is welcome, because they can use this as an advantage for their political campaigns and connect with the people. In such cases, the financial aspect was considered more of a positive point than a negative point among basketball players.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlayer Political Status and Personal Goals\r\n\r\nIn questions 3 and 6, the basketball and football players interviewed were asked about their status within their teams in terms of the nature of their affiliation and their career goals. When asked to evaluate their motivation for wanting to win a game (patriotic vs. political), answers leaned mostly towards patriotism. Many found pride in winning for their country and not for their political party (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, and B4), but B2 and B5 pointed out that since teams represent political parties, it is inevitable not to represent them, and this sometimes overshadows a national or patriotic spirit. The players also highlighted other reasons. For example, F1, F5, B3, and B5 highlighted the importance of personal achievements and career growth in winning trophies, while F2 only stressed the financial aspect. Moreover, F2, F5, B1, and B2 also emphasized on the importance of sportsmanship and using sports to build an ethical environment. On the other hand, B1 and B3 did not give any national or political lean to the question and pointed out that playing or winning games was purely for financial or career-oriented reasons. This section clearly defined the conflict of prioritizing one\u2019s loyalty to their country versus the political party of their team, and it was observed that most were inclined to serve their country.\u00a0\r\n\r\nQuestion 6 targeted a sensitive subject and asked players to discuss or comment about the player\u2019s political affiliation vis-a-vis their team. None of the interviewees admitted their political affiliation except for B5, who stated that he prescribes to the same political views as his team, but he also emphasized the fact that his statement derives from a cultural perspective (Armenian bondage). He also stated that even if he is affiliated, he does not follow them blindly:\u00a0\r\n\r\nI support this party, if I am talking about myself\u2026 but not blindly, you know. There is nothing wrong with people or athletes supporting political parties or having religious philosophies, but extremism and blind following is something that I don\u2019t like and don\u2019t practice.\u00a0 I keep the balance between what is best for me and my team. In the end, it is a sport, so it is not a place where I fight for the cause of the political party; it\u2019s not the case; definitely, it\u2019s not how I work at least. So, I proudly support it because perhaps we as Armenians have a different approach to this idea.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAll interviewees also highlighted the fact that one should not necessarily be affiliated to a certain political party in order to be part of the team. However, some did point out that there might be some favoritism and in certain cases, dismissal, if grave issues arose. For instance, B4 stressed on the fact that while one does not need to be affiliated with the team\u2019s politics, there are clubs who would favor some players over others because of their political affiliation. Additionally, F5 noted that sometimes, getting caught in politics is inevitable for players and might have dire consequences.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlayers, and good players, get caught in that wildfire battle of politics. Some players get kicked off a team. Fans intervene if a player ends up giving his opinion on a political party that contrasts his team\u2019s belief.\r\n\r\nTo gain fans, some players choose not to reveal their political affiliation, and in some cases, clubs might even ask them to remain politically and religiously neutral in order to maintain a good reputation and avoid trouble.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0RQ2: How does an interplay trichotomy exist in relation to sport opinion leaders, teams and fans?\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFans: Voice or Voiceless\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of fan participants (65%) stated that they do not fear voicing their opinions to religious leaders and political figures who are affiliated with their favorite team.\u00a0 However, 50% would feel silenced by them if they offered financial assistance to their teams.\u00a0 Similarly, participants also prefer not to voice their opinions (43%) if it contradicts with the owners of the team and continue supporting the team; the rest of the participants were neutral. Finally, 62.3% of respondents claimed that they have a high sense of solidarity with the team they support no matter what.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFans as Opinion Leaders or Followers\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith respect to fans\u2019 attitudes towards voicing their own opinions and in relation to the Spiral of Silence, the fan participants (65%) claimed that they are often asked about their opinions regarding the games and believe that they can influence other fans (58%), while 14% did not believe they could, and 28% were neutral. Likewise, approximately half of the participants expressed their opinions on social media and did not hold back, while 19% hesitated and 31% preferred to remain neutral.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nInterview results from the closed-ended question portion of the interview show that players view themselves as influencers when it comes to decisions regarding their teams. For example, 70% either agreed or strongly agreed to the fact that they can influence decisions in their areas. Moreover, only 20% do not believe that they have access to information that they need. Finally, 60% disagree or strongly disagree with the statement that highlights their absence of involvement in politics, or as the statement says, \u201cin what the government does.\u201d They believe that they can express their opinions towards governmental decisions. However, when it comes to getting involved in specific issues that matter, there were no significant results due either mixed opinions (f) or their refusal to reply to the statement (g). In the former statement, 50% believe that they cannot contribute to issues that they care about while 30% disagree. The rest 20% are either neutral or refuse to answer the question. While in the latter statement, 60% refused to reply to the statement, marking the results to be inconclusive.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, government-related statements showed accurate results. The majority of the interviewees do not trust the government altogether. For instance, 80% agreed or strongly agreed that politicians are not capable of telling the truth, and 70% agreed that politicians do not involve themselves with important matters. Only 10% agreed that the government strives to do what is right. While these are general viewpoints regarding the attitudes of players towards the government, the results here are significant in a sense because they relate to the perception of players to politics. This is related to the fact that many of the government positions in Lebanon are occupied by its main political parties that usually interfere in different areas including sports.\r\n\r\nCommunication with Fans\r\n\r\nQuestions 4 and 5 were directly related to fans. Question 4 was focused on the means of communications. Most of the interviewees stated that they connect with their fans via social media platforms. Some others stated that they were also ready to connect with fans on a personal basis, including but not limited to during practices, after games, and in public spaces (restaurants, streets, and cafes). None of the interviewees denied communication.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe extent of communication and its impact were discussed in question 5. All respondents agreed that as team members, they can influence their fans in general, except for F4, who stated that he can only encourage fans to do what is right. All expressed their concern about fans\u2019 behavior during games and how it was important for them to be on their best behavior during and after games. The characteristics mentioned across the interviews related to this question included being respectful, ethical, tolerant, fair, civilized, supportive, humble, and sportsmanlike. They also conveyed their desire to have fans that cheer for the team rather than the political party or religion the team is affiliated with and avoid trouble. Many of the interviewees also deemed themselves partly responsible for their fans\u2019 behavior. They considered themselves as potential role models for the fans, and therefore, their behavior should also be exemplary and reflect positively to the fans.\r\n\r\nIn some of the interviews, some players recalled certain events that influenced fans. For example, B1 stated that he \u201conce asked fans of [his] club to stop chanting certain derogatory terms to a specific group, and they accepted and never did it again.\u201d Also, B5 mentioned that he had on many occasions influenced his fans: \u201cI do have the ability to influence our fans because fans need guidance and whichever way you guide them, they will react upon that.\u201d The results show all players have effective ways to communicate and are mostly able to influence their fans to behave in a more respectful and sportsmanlike manner.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nOwners as Opinion Leaders or Followers\r\n\r\nThe following summarizes the communication methods used by the opinion leaders and how they share their thoughts to followers. More than 64% of the respondents stated that the owners of the team that they supported hold media conferences or releases to announce their opinions, and 50% stated that the owners are usually active on social media, communicate with their fans, and have a strong influence on the fans. However, only 26% stated that they follow what the owners ask them to do while 43% disagreed with this, 30% neither agree nor disagree with this statement. Thirty-three percent of fans admitted to replying to owners\u2019 comments, 27% preferred not to reply at all while 40% were neutral.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nIntegration of Politics and Religion in Sports\r\n\r\nReligious Impact on or Religious Devotion to the Game\r\n\r\nThe results of this study show that the political parties in Lebanon are supported by their corresponding religious sects. It then follows that to understand the game, one must understand its people (Montague 2008).\u00a0 For Lebanon, it is hardly surprising that religion and politics become intricately intertwined within and across both communities and states in the region (Maliks 2018). This was confirmed in the results, as a clear link was established between the political and the religious affiliations especially in the Muslim community where the majority of\u00a0 Suuni Muslims support the Future Movement while the Shia Muslims are affiliated with the Hezbollah party and respective teams. These seemingly transparent diverse representations and\/or boundaries present in the sport are governed by their corresponding political party to maintain political security and balance (Faour 2007).\u00a0 This interrelatedness of sports, religion, and politics in Lebanon creates a chain reaction effect; if sports are influenced by one then it must be influenced by the other and similarly if anything impacts politics then the sport (team, fans) too is impacted.\u00a0 Nassif and Amara\u2019s (2015) research show that the over-representation of religious and political communities in the sports industry is inevitably existent in sports.\u00a0 Likewise, Karami (2013) lists important basketball teams, such as Sagesse and Riyadi, and links them to their corresponding political parties, Lebanese Forces (Christian) and Future Movement (Muslim), respectively. He discusses that politics and sectarianism have damaged basketball in Lebanon since this was reflected in a prospective ban of the Lebanese Basketball Association from being a member of FIBA.\u00a0 Similarly, when it comes to football, the intervention of politics in sports is consequential. In their interview, F2 and F3 pointed out how the interference might result in a FIFA ban, similar to the one that occurred in Kuwait. A similar occurrence took place in Egypt, where the politicization of the Ultras caused a football ban by FIFA (Ennarah 2017).\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nBelonging to a political party is not a determinant of religious affiliation.\u00a0 Many of the respondents claimed to be independent however identified themselves as part of a religious group, and few claimed that they are non-religious (e.g., atheist, agnostic etc.).\u00a0 Yet, since many of the politically independent participants were still affiliated religiously as the results suggest, there is a probability that their choice of team support is linked to that of religion rather than politics.\u00a0 This could also relate to the mistrust in politics but not in religion in general.\u00a0 As the majority of respondents indicated one\u2019s religion affects one\u2019s team choice (e.g., Maronite Christians selecting to support Saggesse, Muslim fans selecting Riyadi).\u00a0 Based on the numbers, there was more loyalty to religion than politics, and this could be due to the increase in the number of independents and the ongoing corruption in politics that many of the youth in Lebanon are recognizing.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPerception of Politics and Religion on Sports by the Fans and Players\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe impact of politics and religion on sports was mostly seen negatively, especially among the fans. On the other hand, while all interviewees pointed out the negative impacts, some also considered some of the positive outcomes of this intervention such as the budget.\u00a0 This is the case for the players, as the interviewees indicated, because the world of sports is rarely considered a domain of importance in Lebanon and building a career in the sports industry is often discouraged.\u00a0 Many teams, as a result, resort to politics to secure a budget. Likewise, political candidates resort to sponsoring a team to gain popularity among the people, and this has helped with the advancement of sports. Due to the lack of budget within a sports team, funding has become a necessity no matter the means (Nassif 2010).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, it was acknowledged by the interviewees that political intervention can damage sportsmanship, decrease the productivity of teammates, open doors for discrimination of players, and affect the overall atmosphere of the games, where winning a game can be represented with a symbolic victory of a certain political party or religious sect. These types of political conflicts represented within the teams can promote conflict between the fans (Karami 2013).\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile politics can encourage an increase in the number of fans, as results suggest, so can religion.\u00a0 However, violence can also spark as a result of religious and political tension between the fans of the teams (Maugendre 2018). This can be seen during games when fans of one team can get physically and verbally violent toward the fans of another.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nMatches between Homentmen and\u00a0 Riyadi, for example, have become increasingly popular\u00a0 since they are often a venue for political and religious clashes. This was exacerbated by the fact that the former advanced to a higher rank due to the financial support it began receiving from an Armenian sponsor, Guy Manoukian (Naharnet Newsdesk 2018). The fans usually get heated up in these matches, which either take place in Aghpalian Club (Home Stadium for Homentmen) or the Riyadi Stadium (Manara). The political and religious tensions between the fans are often highlighted during those games, especially due to the former\u2019s affiliation to the Tashnag Armenian party and their zealous campaign against the Turks for the recognition of and reparations for the Armenian Genocide, and the latter\u2019s alliance with the Turkish government (MTV 2017). The games, on multiple occasions, have turned into verbal, emotional, and physical disturbances as Riyadi fans tend to provoke Homentmen fans by raising and waving the flags of Turkey in the stadium and cause violent physical clashes among the fans (MTV 2017).\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt these games, aggressive rivalry dominates the sports arena, and as shown in the Facebook post below with the caption \u201cIt is not a story of commission nor trophy nor triumph. Our passion is Al Riyadi, a passion since childhood (sic).\u201d The extreme loyalty is evident in the picture as Riyadi fans, who most likely belong to Al Mostakbal (Future Movement) political party, are Sunni Muslim.\r\n\r\nFigure 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Facebook Post of a Riyadi Fan during a Homentmen vs. Riyadi Game\r\n\r\nThe Turkish flag they are carrying has multiple connotations. On one hand, it represents their support of Turkey, since their affiliated political party has a strong alliance with the country. On the other hand, the Turkish flag is insulting to Homentmen fans, who belong to the Tashnag party and are of Armenian origin. This Armenian-Turkish rivalry dates back to the times of the 1915 genocide, and relations between them are severed and personal. Even today, any association with Turkey is intolerable and sensitive to most members of the Armenian community. The Turkish flag, therefore, carried by Riyadi fans, is only a means to provoke Tashnag Armenian flags and challenge their identity. An attack on the player, team, political party, or religious sect is an attack on the identity of the fan, an identity that fans most often seek to protect no matter the cost.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nOpinion Leaders, Team, and Fans: An Interplay Trichotomy\r\n\r\nOpinion Leaders\u2019 Influence on Followers\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis study has shown that the majority of the owners influence their followers on social media and occasionally announce their opinions and guide the fan base. However, only a quarter of participants emphasized that they agree with statements, and a slightly higher percentage of fans admitted to avoiding replying to comments and remaining neutral to avoid conflict. Most of the neutral answers were confined to questions concerning vocalizing opinions on social media or disagreeing with opinion leaders. Also, and surprisingly, many fans replied with \u201cneutral\u201d when asked about who funds their favorite team. Whether the reason is their lack of knowledge, fear, or preference not to reply remains unclear. This shows how opinion leaders remain a source of influence, on some issues, for the fans and indirectly govern their behavior or at least manage unwanted reactions. On the other hand, fans do not want to increase conflict for their teams and thus remain neutral or at times confirm the sentiments of the opinion leaders.\u00a0 Some fans seem to be driven by the system as they do not prefer to be involved in the decision-making process and rather prefer to enjoy the game as fans and not deal with the bureaucracy of it. Moreover, respondents claimed that although access to social media can make opinions more accepted, the greater power resides in the hands of those who have more access to media outlets\/platforms, who can make their opinions dominant and accepted by the majority, especially when providing seemingly valuable content.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSlight Paradox Shift\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that owners value their business (their club). That being said, especially with the crises in Lebanon, the club is a priority to fund so that would naturally mean that they would accept funding from various sources, even if they do not prescribe to the same political or religious affiliations. However, opportunities of that sort are rare or do not tend to present themselves, unless the sponsor is affiliated.\u00a0 This was the case with Guy Manoukian, who is a Lebanese-Armenian musician who financially supports the Lebanese Armenian team (Homenetmen) as opposed to any other Lebanese team (Naharnet 2018).\u00a0 The teams get external sponsors, like Manoukian, and are not funded by the actual political party the team is affiliated to, nonetheless the political connection remains, more so with the fans than the players or owners \u2013 resulting in this paradox.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlso, if owners perceive the club as their business, they would be more likely to recruit the \u2018best\u2019 players for their team and that too means recruitment across political and religious affiliations. An example of this, and an exception to the aforementioned arguments, is the current change with the teams that have been mentioned throughout the paper as predominately Christian (Sagesse) and the Muslim (Riyadi).\u00a0 The captain of the Sagesse team is Ali Mezher a Shia Muslim, and the captain of Riyadi is Jean Abdelnour who is Christian (Lebanese Forces) (LBF 2022) \u2013 another paradox relating to the players.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTeam Players Influencing Decision Making and Fans\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe results showed that most team players view themselves as valuable members of the team; however, they did not deny the occasional pressure that might arise from the administration. This is in accordance with Nassif and Amara (2015) who stated that the hiring process of both administration and team can be biased towards those who support the political agenda. In the case of the Lebanese league, religious and political considerations can be integrated into the selection process, but many team members that were interviewed denied any political connection and stated that they were content in their team and were involved in the decision-making process.\u00a0 Players do not try to claim affiliations because they often get recruited from one team to another, and\u00a0 thus want to widen their opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nTeammates believe that they can influence decisions made in the team.\u00a0 Research shows that many sports teams in Lebanon are funded by certain political figures or parties, and this creates a complex club-team-fan dynamic (Nassif and Amara 2015).\u00a0 Needing the sponsorship and the funds, teams sometimes tend to accept or overlook certain decisions made by owners, and even if some do not agree with the decisions, they tend to continue supporting them.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis influence in decision making can also be the result of the incompetence of decision-making members. As previously stated, around 90% of the team organizers are considered unqualified for the positions they are in and were only selected because of their political or religious affiliation (Nassif and Amara 2015), this creates an antagonistic perspective of the club management from both the fans and teams perspective, especially if the fan is independent (not belonging to the team\u2019s political party). The interviewees also pointed this out, and some considered that this has also affected the hiring process.\u00a0 Although the majority of the interviewees claimed that they were not politically affiliated, they stated that most of their team members belong to the political party and\/or religion the club is affiliated with and probably have more influence in the decision-making process.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMoreover, the players emphasized their influence on the fans in general. All players stated that they may influence the way that their fans behave in and outside of the\u00a0 arena. Most players even considered themselves as strong influencers and do not entertain foul behavior from the fans. As a result, many of the players consider themselves potential opinion leaders capable of influencing the public, particularly their fans.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFans: Leaders and Influencers\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe results of this study showed that more than half of the fans believe that their opinions regarding games matter and are also able to influence other fans. In relation to the Two-Step Flow theory, some fans consider themselves opinion leaders in relation to the other fans. Many of the fan respondents consider themselves as potential leaders capable of affecting other fans.\u00a0 In the trichotomy, fans in numbers are the majority, however in decision making and power, they are the minority. Minority groups can become opinion leaders if they believe they can make a difference or are capable and have the means (e.g., social media platforms) to share their opinions (Bastos et al. 2013); as was the case with the fan participants who believe that they can influence their teams.\u00a0 Perhaps then being fans of major sports teams creates a force to speak up and\/or challenge authority, or even how sports (e.g., football) has the potential to be a cultural tool that can change the social order (Dorsey 2016). Even though sports in Lebanon are influenced by politics and religion, many of the fans believe that they can influence the team and that their opinion matters. This could be due to the spread of social media platforms that encourage freedom of expression.\u00a0 Also, it can potentially be attributed to a younger generation of fans who are willing to freely express their thoughts and challenge the status quo.\u00a0 Yet, it might also be that their opinions are already synced with and\/or invested in the political parties involved and thus feel as if they have a sense of power to speak up and contribute to the team, hence the interplay trichotomy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, this interplay is dynamic, and fans feel that they prefer not to voice their opinions when a matter could endanger the overall wellbeing of the political party, especially if that political party is funding the team, hence the Spiral of Silence effect. Fans do not deny the influence of owners and political leaders on mass opinion but deny the fact that they are silenced. This does not mean though that they would not voice their loyalty to the team. There are several\u00a0 reasons this may be the case. Many of the fans consider themselves extremely loyal to the political party they belong to, and even in the sports sector, they tend not to express their opinions since they do not want to upset their political leaders (again especially when they are team sponsors) or the mass opinion. This Spiral of Silence effect in which fans, depending on their level of belonging to a certain political party or religious sect, would hesitate to share any form of opinion on social media fearing criticism and isolation from other devoted fans. This too is in line with the Two-Step Flow theory, which posits that depending on a person\u2019s perceived level of prominence (e.g., the higher the level of belonging the greater the support and power) others will then choose to follow in the same direction.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSince this study was aimed at fans who would be influenced by others on social media rather than in a physical setting, it is perhaps easier to avoid providing opinions online when the comments they might be receiving are hostile while in a supposedly friendly environment (i.e. social media team page). However, the fact that they refuse to be silenced could be a pride issue as most stated that they tend not to give their opinions if it contrasts the majority view. This does not deny the presence of a power struggle but also seems not to accept full affiliation to the opinions of owners.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFans might not psychologically accept the fact that they are fully governed by a higher political body and might want to assert individual thinking and autonomy. This perspective allows the individual to have a sense of freedom; a feeling that they can separate their passion for the sport from their political ideologies.\u00a0 Also, since the discussions are usually put forward on social media, many participants would want to display their loyalty to their team, and as the results indicated, 65% of participants would be ready to voice their opinions against political and religious figures. Perhaps only those who are particularly confident and those who are independent in thought might express their opinions more freely.\u00a0 Needless to say, many have lost trust in the government all together.\r\nLimitations\r\nThere are several limitations to this study. One of the major limitations was time constraint and the global situation (e.g., COVID-19). Because of the pandemic, the interviews could not be conducted face to face, so most of them were done through Skype and Whatsapp. What complicated data collection was that some interviewees refused to answer certain questions, and this did not allow the interviewer to have substantial content for some questions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe sample representation and size were also an issue due to the limited time and religious affiliation. The respondents were mostly Shia Muslim, which did not provide an equal demographic distribution. This was also due to the fact that many sports platforms, which belonged to different political\/religious affiliations, refused to post the questionnaire on their sports pages.\u00a0\r\nImplications and Future Research\r\nThis study examined the inevitable influence of politics and religion on sports in Lebanon. The results clearly indicated how both fans and players were fully affected by this phenomenon, and while team independence was highlighted in certain cases and most were looking forward to having this interference removed, it was clear that this influence will continue in sports since the issue of finance still stands, especially after the economic crises in Lebanon. This study has highlighted the attitude of both fans and players regarding the integration of politics in sports and has shed light on both the negative and positive aspects of this integration. Also, the different attitudes of fans towards loyalty to political parties and religious sects and their connection to the respective teams were a novel point in the study. Interestingly, the slight difference in attitude between basketball and football is also a key finding from this study as the rise in popularity of basketball due to increased funding is viewed favorably by fans and players regardless of political affiliation. The results of this research, however, could inspire future complementary research. For example, research should be done comparing the situation of men's teams versus women's teams.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFinally, to tackle the issue of political and religious interference in Lebanon, it is crucial to introduce laws that do not allow the interference of politics and religion in sports by managing the source of funding the team receives and ensuring that each team includes people of all religions and minorities. This can also allow fans to make their decisions based on the qualifications of the teams and their players rather than the club\u2019s political or religious affiliation. This might be difficult to achieve, considering the context of Lebanon, but it is not impossible. The teams can ask for financial help from organizations\/companies\/institutions that do not have any political or religious affiliation. Also, monitoring players, fans, coaches, and administration from clubs help in keeping the political and religious tension at bay. Finally, raising awareness by organizing campaigns can also be a small yet positive step towards achieve political and religious segregation from sports.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that politics and religion play a major role in sports in Lebanon. Many fans and players are caught between the tumultuous political battles that subtly reflected in the administration of clubs and games. It is safe to assume that the involvement of politics and religion in Lebanon\u2019s many fields, including that of sports, is a complicated matter and will need years to resolve.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"",""image"":{""@type"":""ImageObject"",""url"":""https:\/\/www.arabmediasociety.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/6835062038_42b3f42057_k.jpg"",""width"":2048,""height"":1536}}</script> </article><p class=""post-tag"">Tags <a href=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/tag/basketball/"" rel=""tag"">basketball</a> <a href=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/tag/football/"" rel=""tag"">Football</a> <a href=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/tag/lebanon/"" rel=""tag"">Lebanon</a> <a href=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/tag/politics/"" rel=""tag"">Politics</a> <a href=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/tag/religion/"" rel=""tag"">Religion</a> <a href=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/tag/spiral-of-silence-theory/"" rel=""tag"">Spiral of Silence theory</a> <a href=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/tag/sports/"" rel=""tag"">Sports</a> <a href=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/tag/two-step-flow-theory/"" rel=""tag"">Two-Step flow theory</a></p><section id=""author-box""><div class=""block-head""><h3>About Ahmad Nasrallah &amp; Jessica R.

The researcher relied on both discourse and content analysis to analyze 41,505 comments that were published on the Egyptian Al-Ahly Club page on Facebook about the 2018 African Champions League final between Al-Ahly and the Tunisian Esperance team. The study relied on Jonathan Culpeper's impoliteness model (1996). The results showed the spread of hate speech among Arab sports fans on social media; where hate speech appeared in nearly half of the comments subject to the analysis. The results also revealed that hate speech was not limited to the sports reference frame only; rather, it also included the social, political, religious, and historical reference frames. The results showed that males use impolite speech more than females, and that anonymity is not the influential factor in producing impolite speech through social media. </span></p><h3 style=""direction: rtl;""><b>خطاب الكراهية لدى مشجعي الأندية الرياضية العربية على مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي: دراسة تحليلية لحساب النادي الأهلي المصري على فيسبوك</b></h3><p style=""direction: rtl;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">سعت هذه الدراسة إلى رصد خطاب الكراهية الذي ينتجه مشجعو الأندية الرياضية العربية على مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي؛ حيث قام الباحث بتحليل 41505 تعليقات تمَّ نشرها على الصفحة الرسمية للنادي الأهلي المصري على موقع فيسبوك حول نهائي دوري أبطال أفريقيا عام 2018، بين فريقي النادي الأهلي المصري، ونادي الترجي التونسي. واعتمدت على نموذج عدم التأدب الذي وضعه Culpeper Jonathan، وأوضحت نتائجها انتشار خطاب الكراهية بين مشجعي الأندية الرياضية العربية؛ حيث ظهر هذا الخطاب فيما يقرب من نصف التعليقات الخاضعة للتحليل، كما كشفت النتائج عدم اقتصار خطاب الكراهية على الإطار المرجعي الرياضي فقط؛ وإنما شمل الإطار المرجعي الاجتماعي والسياسي والديني والتاريخي، وأوضحت أن الذكور أكثر استخداما لخطاب الكراهية عبر مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي مقارنة بالإناث، ووجود تأثير لإخفاء هوية المستخدم في إنتاج خطاب الكراهية عبر مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي.</span></p><p><br style=""font-weight: 400;""/></p></div><div class=""clear""></div></div> <script type=""application/ld+json"">{""@context"":""http:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""NewsArticle"",""dateCreated"":""2022-10-01T21:15:30+00:00"",""datePublished"":""2022-10-01T21:15:30+00:00"",""dateModified"":""2022-10-08T18:33:48+00:00"",""headline"":""Hate Speech Between Arab Sports Fans on Social Media (Arabic)"",""name"":""Hate Speech Between Arab Sports Fans on Social Media (Arabic)"",""keywords"":""Hate Speech,Impoliteness Model,Social Media,Sports Fans"",""url"":""https:\/\/www.arabmediasociety.com\/hate-speech-between-arab-sports-fans-on-social-media\/"",""description"":""Scroll down for Arabic abstract.

In analyzing the results to explore the participants’ motivation in their use of social media for sports, the study indicates that entertainment and information-seeking were the main motivations for women consuming sports on social media. The overall findings also suggest that social media plays a pivotal role in driving Arab females’ interests in sports.</span></p><h4><b>Introduction</b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While mainstream media has not always been accessible to everyone, the emergence of social media platforms in recent years has given users the opportunity to hand-select their favorite content and programs more easily than ever (Bayor et al. 2018; Sedky et al. 2020). Social media users engage on these platforms for a variety of reasons, but the most common reason for use is entertainment. Social media allows users to connect not only with friends and family, but with celebrities and influencers, it also helps them acquire knowledge and learn new skills (Corso and Robinson 2013; Rogers 2020; Whiting and Williams 2013). </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It has been noted that sports fans, both males and females, read and present their opinions on sports across social media platforms. Many of these fans use platforms for ‘fan-ship’ reasons. This term, coined by Woods and Butler (2020), is used to describe the motives of social media users who create fan pages on Facebook for their favorite athletes or celebrities. Thorpe et al. (2017), however, assert that the expansion of social media use has played a pivotal role in increasing visibility, generating conversation, and driving online engagement around women’s sports in particular. Not only do female athletes use social media to develop their profiles, sports fans and audiences use the platforms to connect with one another (Bruce 2016). French (2013) has observed that, while women use social media more than men, men use it for sports and entertainment more frequently. Women, on the contrary, are likely to watch their favorite athletes via social media platforms but may also use these outlets for socializing, following celebrities, and other activities (French 2013). Evidence suggests that women tend to use social media in these ways because it gives them easy access to searchable content, so that they no longer have to rely on TV to access their favorite programs (Chua and Chang 2016; Lou and Yuan 2019). Because social media platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook, give users easy access to content, Abeza et al. (2015) have noted that these users are increasingly relying on them to access sports-related content.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As for gender roles in Arab society, social media is becoming a game-changer because it has attracted a sizeable majority of Arab women who have found new ways to participate in debates and discussions on subjects ranging from politics to entertainment and sports (Hurley 2019). Alnjadat et al. (2019), for example, observe that social media has a more significant impact on the academic performance of Arab women than Arab men. Women reported that social media negatively affected their academic achievement, while men are found to be more addicted to social media platforms than them.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alzahrani and Alanzi (2019) also studied the impact of social media platforms on people with diabetes. They concluded that Saudi women prefer using WhatsApp and Twitter to gain better knowledge about their health and to keep in touch with their acquaintances. Similarly, Ahmed et al. (2018) found that Arab women prefer to use social media platforms such as Instagram or Facebook to socialize with friends and to spread information about brands, purchasing, and selling. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For Arab women, however, the use of social media is not limited to socializing, academia, or content searches. It has also become a key source of engagement for Arab women interested in sports. Ahmed and Thorpe (2020) show that female athletes using social media sites (i.e., Instagram and Facebook), have begun to challenge the stereotypes surrounding women in sports, significantly influencing female audiences to look for sports content, news, and sports events. Recently, social media posts related to female athletes have gone viral and have even been reposted by those with occupations not related to sports. The increasing participation in sports from Arab countries and its promotion on social media platforms has encouraged the region’s domestic audiences to reexamine their cultural perception of sports, particularly women’s sports. Additionally, sports role models and athletes featured on social media have encouraged Arab women to take an interest and consider participating in sports, thus breaking stereotypes and changing perceptions towards sports (AlKhalifa and Farello, 2021).</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This examines the factors that motivate Arab women to use social media to follow sports as well as the role that social media plays developing their interest in sports. It also explicitly addresses the sports-related social media needs and interests of Arab women. Within media scholarship, there is limited research on Arab women’s interest in sports, particularly in the GCC region. Thus, this subject deserves further exploration, and this research aims to fill that gap. The current study is based on uses and gratification theory, which explores how individuals use media for entertainment, information-seeking, socializing, and self-status aspects (</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sheffer and Schultz 2014)</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. It evaluates which of the aforementioned factors motivate Arab women and contribute to their interest in sports. The theory is discussed in the following section of the paper. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The study addresses the following research questions:</span></p><ol><li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Which uses and gratification theory dimensions (entertainment, information-seeking, socializing, and self-status) significantly contribute to an interest in sports among female audiences in Arab countries? </span></li><li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Which other needs and motivations, including access to content, accessibility, economics, education, and fan-ship, significantly impact the level of interest that Arab women have in sports?</span></li></ol><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The research paper also evaluates the demographic characteristics of Arab women with interests in sports, including their age, educational background, and employment status.</span></p><ol><li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Does age significantly influence the extent of interest among Arab women in sports?</span></li><li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Does the extent of interest in sports among Arab women differ depending on education levels?</span></li><li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Does employment status significantly impact the level of interest Arab women have in sports?</span></li></ol><h4><b>Theoretical and Empirical Evidence</b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the context of social media and mass media, Blumler and Katz’s (1973) theory of uses and gratification asserts that modern society is goal-oriented and actively seeks or uses media to achieve its goals. Through social media, members of society aim to fulfill their needs of gratification and desires as social media platforms enable individuals to engage, communicate, and maintain relationships (</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sheffer and Schultz 2014)</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. In the era of digital expansion, individuals using networking platforms can combine various platforms to achieve maximum gratification. In this realm, as discussed previously, social media also provides users a platform to voice their opinions and communicate their perceptions to a larger public audience (Hurley 2019). The users of media platforms are reliant on traditional mediums for accessing information regarding political, sports, and economic trends. Still, they have access to a combination of different platforms—such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.—where they can share, create, and seek information. Hence the uses and gratification theory allows researchers to evaluate how users meet their needs related to emotional connection, information-seeking, and status through social media (Froget et al. 2013). </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blumler and Katz (1973) initially divided media users’ motivations into five groups: cognitive needs, social needs, personal needs, affection needs, and the need to relax. Modifying the theory, Park et al. (2009) reduced these categories into four gratification dimensions that relate to the usage of social media platforms. These dimensions include entertainment, information-seeking, socializing, and self-status aspects, which the current study employs in later sections.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The information-seeking aspect refers to individuals who satisfy their need for education and information on trends through media (Eginli and Tas 2018). The entertainment aspect concerns individuals who use a combination of social media platforms for entertainment and leisure. The socializing aspect relates to individuals who used the platform to interact, communicate, and engage with like-minded people in order to maintain and form new relationships while receiving societal acceptance and validation (Park et al. 2009). The self-status aspect relates to individuals who use social media platforms to add value and status to their lives. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Consequently, the role of social media has been considered positive in meeting the needs of individuals by enabling them to engage, be involved, and take an interest in different domains and fields, such as fashion, arts, media, politics, sports, and entertainment, etc. (Heinonen 2011; Kowalczyk and Pounders 2016; Yoo and Gretzel 2011). In this context, the current study uses these four social media dimensions of uses and gratification theory to test whether they are significant contributors to surveyed Arab females developing an interest in sports.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As discussed earlier, people are motivated to use social media for entertainment, profile-surfing, self-status development, and socializing with their family and friends (Brandtzæg and Heim 2009). Young Len-Ríos and Young (2017) found that female users in particular are motivated to use social media for entertainment, information, or news, and Plume and Slade (2018) noted that women in the UK are more likely to be influenced by relationship maintenance and social interaction, compared to men who are interested in seeking information from posts or videos, however, no significant difference is found between the men and women’s behavioral intention for sharing sponsored advertisement (Plume and Slade 2018). Similarly, Shi et al. (2016) examined the effect of social media brand pages among users and found that women consider entertainment more favorable because it meets their emotional needs; therefore, they are motivated to use social media for continued social interactions. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With its easy accessibility, social media has allowed users to access sports coverage and content globally and digital media has played a vital role in attracting viewers to sporting events. Around 60% of sports fans use social media to search for online sport updates or athletes' information due to its convenience and quick access (Creedon 2014). The platform creators themselves have also applied this information to conduct statistical analysis of user engagement. Billings et al. (2017), for example, found that Snapchat users in the US use the Snapchat app to follow sports or research sports-related information. While these surveyed fans used other platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook for social interaction and sports information, Snapchat was considered significantly helpful for facilitating an interest in sports among fans. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Comparing these statistics to those in the Arab world, it has been noted that the use of Snapchat is also increasing among Arab users; in 2018, the company released the Arabic language version of the application encouraging millions to increase their usage (Radcliffe and Brune 2018). However, Snapchat usage for sports, particularly among Arabs, has not been given much attention.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the other hand, in the western world, platforms like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook have also been studied. For example, Meng et al. (2015) analyzed the types of content on Facebook and Twitter being produced by users in North America, and it has been observed that the National Basketball Association (NBA) delivered sports-related information to sports fans, thereby branding their communication. Meanwhile, female fans who use Twitter and Facebook take more interest in searching for information or posting content on these platforms during a game (Abdourazakou and Deng 2019).</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In studies on media representations of women’s athletics, however, Cooky et al. (2013) have noted that mainstream media covers women's sports less frequently than men's sports, thus marginalizing and silencing women athletes. Research conducted by Litchfield and Kavanagh (2019) examined the gender representation of sports athletes in social media coverage of the 2016 Olympic Games with a focus on Australian teams. The study found that males and females were represented differently on social media platforms. For instance, there were more ‘active images’ of male athletes compared to female ones. Another American-based study by Coche (2013) concluded that 72% of the articles on the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN) website and social media pages focused more on men’s tennis compared to women's tennis (20%), while the remaining 8% were other stories about tennis as a sport. This lack of coverage has ultimately driven fan engagement on social media platforms and these platforms continue to play an important role in the promotion of women's sports and fan engagement (Vann 2014). Social media consumption has been positively linked with sports events and patronage, and female sports fans have been motivated to follow sports-related information and news on social media, and enjoy interacting with athletes' posts and purchasing their products (Hazari 2018).</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It should also be noted that scholars in the west have thoroughly explored and examined the sport-related content on social media and what motivates both genders to consume such type of content on different social media accounts. For example, French (2013) argued that most women consume sports-related content through social media platforms for the purposes of connecting with their close contacts, while men tend to engage with the sports content on social media mainly to identify with their favorite teams and engage in other sports-related activity.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The literature concerning the use of social media for sports among Arab women is still nascent. Studies examining the needs and motivations behind the consumption of sports-related content on social media among Arab women are still limited. Although many researchers have begun to view the use of social media in the Arab world as pivotal for garnering and developing sports acceptance locally, most studies have treated Arab women’s social media use and Arab women’s interest in sports as separate phenomena. Al-Jenaibi (2011) has observed that women from the UAE use social media for entertainment, business development, and gathering news. Similarly, Vieweg and Hodges (2016) have noted that Qatari women use social media for socializing and entertainment ends, such as posting photos and videos, giving and receiving likes, commenting, and gathering information. Similarly, Elareshi Ziani and Al Shami (2021) have highlighted how Bahraini women use social media to share information and spend an average of three hours daily on social media enjoying entertainment clips, comics, and reading news stories and content. Meanwhile, AlKhalifa and Farello (2021) have researched how women's football committees in GCC countries are using social media to create awareness about the sport, which has positively affected female fans. Theodorakis et al. (2017) have also found that Qatari women use social media to follow sport events and discuss sport-related information with friends and family.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This paper also examines how fan-ship (Witkemper et al., 2012) motivates female sports lovers to use different mediums, such as social media platforms, to form an emotional relationship with an athlete or team. Studies have also found that accessing sports through social media is popular among Qatari fans, as it was reported that 35% of female fans use social media for fan-ship or to follow sports-related content twice a week (Theodorakis et al. 2017). D'Andrea and Mintz (2019) have stated that social media users in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries consume sports for entertainment purposes and share sports-related memes, preferably on Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. Nabulsi (2014) found that Palestinian youth use social media to share football-related memes and relate them with their movement and cause. Monaghan (2014) noted that social media is increasingly used for football fan activism and meme creation. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This study lastly examines how demographic factors, such as education and occupation, impact Arab women in developing interest in sports-related social media content. Irem et al. (2014) have discussed how social media has become a key platform and source of information (e.g., education, entertainment, news, and sports) that has swept the traditional patriarchal culture in many of the Arab countries, thus allowing students to share their assignments and work with friends and classmates. Al</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">‐</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hamdan et al. (2021) add similar perspectives explaining that, while girls in Saudi Arabia are not provided with sports education or attend sports activities in public schools, they use social media to acquire education regarding physical activities and sports. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, this information-sharing has had a significant impact on physical education in Arab countries, as many schools put sports classes, assembly exercises, and other related work on hold (Al Lily et al., 2021). Thus, students relied on social media for their education. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While it can be argued that, irrespective of gender, several needs and motivations encourage people to use social media, limited studies have explored what factors influence Arab women to use social media for sports. This study attempts to address this gap through quantitative findings. Based on the literature, the current study also evaluates other needs and motivations behind Arab women’s developing interest in sports along with the four dimensions of uses and gratification theory (Park et al. 2009). These include access to social media platforms (Creedon 2014), accessibility to content available on social media platforms which otherwise is not available on traditional communication mediums (Mohamed 2016), economic aspects, education (AI Lily et al. 2021; Hamdan et al. 2021) and ‘fan-ship’ (Witkemper et al. 2012; Woods and Butler 2020). </span></p><h4><b>Methodology</b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This paper used a quantitative research methodology and a survey strategy. An online survey questionnaire was created on Google Forms and was filled out by 412 Arab women through social media platforms, email, and WhatsApp groups. One completely blank case was removed; therefore, the final sample size of the study was 411.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A convenience sampling strategy was used in this paper to reach as many Arab women as possible. Participants were instructed to fill out the web survey about the dimensions of uses and gratification theory (information need, socializing, entertainment need, and self-status need) and other social media needs and motivations for sports as found in the literature (accessibility, economic aspect, ‘fan-ship’ aspect, education, and content accessibility aspect). These items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale as factors of latent independent variables. Meanwhile, the dependent variable of ‘developing interest’ was measured by gauging the level of awareness that Arab women have about sports events and trends around the world, as well as their perception of and attraction to sports-related content on social media. This was also measured using a 5-point Likert Scale. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The questionnaire was divided into four sections:</span></p><ol><li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first section measured respondents’ demographic characteristics, including age, educational status, employment status, and country. </span></li><li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second section determined the hours they spent on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok. </span></li><li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The third section of the survey included 5-point Likert Scale questions regarding the dimensions of uses and gratification theory and other needs and motivations of using social media.</span></li><li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The fourth section focused on respondents’ awareness level, perception, and interests to measure the dependent variable through a 5-point Likert scale. </span></li></ol><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The researcher began the study by cleaning the data using MS Excel in order to perform a demographic analysis (frequency analysis) using SPSS 25.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Moreover, the data was analyzed using Smart PLS, where partial least square path model (PLS-PM) was run to examine whether the independent variables (information, social need, entertainment need, and self-status need; accessibility impact, economic aspect, ‘fan-ship’ aspect, educational aspect and content accessibility aspect) significantly impacted the dependent variable (dependent variable). Further, IBM SPSS software was used to test the impact of demographic characteristics on the level of interest in sports that Arab women have developed over time. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before performing the PLS test and assessing relationships via other inferential tests, the researcher performed data quality checks, including reliability tests (Cronbach's alpha, rho A, composite reliability) and validity tests (AVE and discriminant validity). All tests were performed via Smart PLS 3.</span></p><h4><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Table 1.

connected with friends and colleagues” (M = 4.37, SD = 0799), which correlates with the social interaction aspect of the uses and gratification theory. Hence, some Arab women are motivated to use social media for sports to fulfill social desires of engaging and maintaining relationships. This item was followed by another one that read, “Having my personal laptop/mobile phone makes it easier for me to access and be present on social media platforms” (M = 4.21, SD = 0.915), suggesting the importance of accessibility. The respondents also rated the items referring to 'usefulness' highly as they believed social media helped them gain new skills, learn new things, and access up-to-date information.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the other hand, the “economic aspect” factor scored comparatively low. One of the social aspects, “Everyone I know has used or uses social media platforms” had the lowest mean score (M = 2.54, SD = 1.374). This score indicated that there were still individuals who did not use social media platforms.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the same context of sports, Arab women mostly agreed that social media  allows them to post their opinions to the world in a way that traditional media does not (M = 3.81, SD = 1.035). Social media also allows them to engage in conversations related to sports (M = 3.77, SD = 1.018), which points to the importance of the information-seeking aspect of the uses and gratification theory. Moreover, many women also considered the 'fan-ship reasons' important to their use, with a mean score of 3.77 each, such that most of the respondents follow athletes over social media because they are fans of athletes and sports in general. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The lowest mean scores pertained to the education/academic context. The respondents had a similarly low mean score when social media was used for education/job purposes. For instance, the item, “I use social media for sports as a part of my job” had a mean value equal to 2.65. </span></p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=""6""><h4><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Table 6.

Among social media needs and motivations, accessibility, access to content, fan-ship, and economic aspects were significant, while in the context of uses and gratification theory dimensions, entertainment and information were statistically significant. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This data means that greater access to content, greater accessibility, economic benefits, greater entertainment, fan-ship, and more information contributed to the development of an interest in sports among Arab women. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The study also evaluates the relationships between Arab females’ demographic characteristics and the extent of their interest in sports. First, this research study evaluates whether age significantly influenced the extent of interest among Arab women in sports. </span></p><h4><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Table 9.

Overall, employment status significantly impacted the level of interest that the surveyed Arab women have in sports (F = 15.284, p &lt; 0.001).</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Individually, self-employed Arab women were most interested in sports, as indicated by the fact that they had the highest mean score in the extent of interest in sports, followed by full-time and part-time employees. Moreover, the unemployed and ‘other’ employment status groups (such as women who were retired, housewives, etc.) had a significantly low mean interest in sports than the other groups. </span></p><h4><b>Discussion</b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In discussing the results from the lens of existing theories and reviewed literature, the findings align with the theories of social media put forward in the introduction. Before evaluating whether social media has been effective in driving the interest of female audiences in sports, it is important to shed light on the aspects motivating Arab women to use social media in general. For example, the descriptive statistics (See Table 5) indicated that the majority of the women surveyed were attracted or convinced to use social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc., because these platforms helped them to socially connect with friends and colleagues. These statistics suggest that women from Arab countries mostly use social media platforms to fulfill their social needs. It allows them to socialize with other people for the purpose of building and maintaining quality social relationships and enhancing social interactions. This is supported by the findings of another study</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">that justified Arab women’s use of social media for social and personal reasons as it helps them keep in touch with friends. (Alzahrani and Alzani 2019)</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Likewise, women in western societies use social media to keep in touch and maintain relationships with their social connections. Park et al. (2009) as well as </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Plume</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and Slade, (2018) argue that women use social media platforms to expand their social circles and to interact and communicate with like-minded people. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another significant dimension in the uses and gratification theory that was linked with the consumption of sports-related content on social media was the entertainment-seeking dimension. (</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Witkemper et al. 2012</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) The entertainment dimension of the uses and gratification theory shows that Arab females are motivated to use different types of social media accounts during their leisure time as well (Park et al. 2009). </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Apart from uses and gratification dimensions, most users following sports through social media outlets use these platforms to access content that is not available on traditional media and that allows them to voice their opinions and engage in conversations about sports (See Table 5). For example, in studies by Plume and Slade (2018) and Ahmed and Thorpe (2020), researchers identified the same behavior among women asserting that most women who used social media in the context of sports chose to share their views and engage in conversations related to sports or politics from which they might otherwise have been restricted. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the causal analysis the results showed that out of the four uses and gratification theory’s dimensions, entertainment-seeking and information-seeking aspects of social media had a statistically significant impact on Arab women’s developing interest in sports. However, other uses and gratification dimensions, such as social and self-status-seeking motivations, have had an insignificant impact on Arab women’s interest in sports. Furthermore, social media usage aspects, such as economic aspects and accessibility, were significant and positively contributed towards developing and enhancing the interest of Arab women in sports (See Table 8). The findings correlate with the literature put forward by Creedon (2014), who explains that digital media can significantly impact people’s interests and preferences due to its global accessibility. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Additionally, based on the fact that the most common uses of social media (such as access to better content, informative news, and entertaining content) are significant factors for Arab females developing more of an interest in sports, this study further supports the findings of Rajakumar (2021); </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Theodorakis et al. (2017);</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Creedon (2014); Irem et al. (2014), and Hull et al. (2019). These authors discuss the key role that social media platforms play in influencing and changing audiences' perception of and level of interest in sports by making people aware of the current sporting trends and events around the world (Theodorakis et al. 2017). </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Overall, the results confirm that the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others, are playing a significant role in Arab women’s interest in sports. The results also confirm that Arab women’s demographic characteristics, such as age groups, educational level, and employment status, play a significant role in impacting their interest in sports. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even though the results of the current study provide valuable findings and contribute to the research gap identified, the chosen methodology and techniques may have limited a holistic understanding of the relationship between Arab women and sports-related social media content. For example, considering that the impact of social media on female audiences’ interest in sports is a relatively new topic in the Arab region, a qualitative analysis via interviews could have provided in-depth and detailed results. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Moreover, although the PLS path model is a value-added analysis, it limits the present study’s analytical scope. For example, content analysis techniques via social media platforms—such as Facebook comments, Twitter tweets, and Instagram posts or stories—could have helped broaden the current study's scope by helping researchers identify how women engage with sports-related content and how social media influences their perception of, knowledge of, and interest in sports. Finally, the limitations of the sample size should also be considered, the surveyed population is too small to generalize or draw conclusions on strong themes about the Arab region in its entirety. </span></p><h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The objective of the current research paper is to determine the impact of social media in developing Arab women’s interests in sports. It observed that social media play a significant role in increasing visibility and driving online engagement regarding sports among Arab women. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This study specifically focused on the way Arab women use social media in sports. Based on a sample of 411 Arab females, the study finds that access to content, fan-ship, and information-seeking reasons are the most important motivations that explain why Arab women consume sports content on social media platforms.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Economic, accessibility, and entertainment aspects significantly predict interest in sports among Arab women. Moreover, social media needs and motivations have a positive impact on the level of interests developed among Arab women.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Demographic factors significantly influence the extent of interests in sports among Arab women. According to the results of this study, Arab women who are self-employed, young and have a bachelor’s degree are more interested in sports than women who have other demographic characteristics. These findings suggest that social media could be used effectively to raise awareness and develop interests in different types of sports among Arab women. </span></p><p> </p></div><div class=""clear""></div></div> <script type=""application/ld+json"">{""@context"":""http:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""NewsArticle"",""dateCreated"":""2022-09-21T19:11:59+00:00"",""datePublished"":""2022-09-21T19:11:59+00:00"",""dateModified"":""2022-10-10T12:19:02+00:00"",""headline"":""The Role of Social Media in Developing Interests in Sports Among Arab Women"",""name"":""The Role of Social Media in Developing Interests in Sports Among Arab Women"",""keywords"":""Arab Women,Motivations,Social Media,Sports,Uses and Gratification Theory"",""url"":""https:\/\/www.arabmediasociety.com\/the-role-of-social-media-in-developing-interests-in-sports-among-arab-women\/"",""description"":""Abstract This paper examines the impact of social media in developing Arab women\u2019s interest in sports.

A survey questionnaire based on the uses and gratification theory was distributed to 411 Arab women from different age groups, education levels, and employment statuses. In analyzing the results to explore the participants\u2019 motivation in their use of social media for sports, the study indicates that entertainment and information-seeking were the main motivations for women consuming sports on social media. The overall findings also suggest that social media plays a pivotal role in driving Arab females\u2019 interests in sports.\r\nIntroduction\r\nWhile mainstream media has not always been accessible to everyone, the emergence of social media platforms in recent years has given users the opportunity to hand-select their favorite content and programs more easily than ever (Bayor et al. 2018; Sedky et al. 2020). Social media users engage on these platforms for a variety of reasons, but the most common reason for use is entertainment. Social media allows users to connect not only with friends and family, but with celebrities and influencers, it also helps them acquire knowledge and learn new skills (Corso and Robinson 2013; Rogers 2020; Whiting and Williams 2013).\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt has been noted that sports fans, both males and females, read and present their opinions on sports across social media platforms. Many of these fans use platforms for \u2018fan-ship\u2019 reasons. This term, coined by Woods and Butler (2020), is used to describe the motives of social media users who create fan pages on Facebook for their favorite athletes or celebrities. Thorpe et al. (2017), however, assert that the expansion of social media use has played a pivotal role in increasing visibility, generating conversation, and driving online engagement around women\u2019s sports in particular. Not only do female athletes use social media to develop their profiles, sports fans and audiences use the platforms to connect with one another (Bruce 2016). French (2013) has observed that, while women use social media more than men, men use it for sports and entertainment more frequently. Women, on the contrary, are likely to watch their favorite athletes via social media platforms but may also use these outlets for socializing, following celebrities, and other activities (French 2013). Evidence suggests that women tend to use social media in these ways because it gives them easy access to searchable content, so that they no longer have to rely on TV to access their favorite programs (Chua and Chang 2016; Lou and Yuan 2019). Because social media platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook, give users easy access to content, Abeza et al. (2015) have noted that these users are increasingly relying on them to access sports-related content.\r\n\r\nAs for gender roles in Arab society, social media is becoming a game-changer because it has attracted a sizeable majority of Arab women who have found new ways to participate in debates and discussions on subjects ranging from politics to entertainment and sports (Hurley 2019). Alnjadat et al. (2019), for example, observe that social media has a more significant impact on the academic performance of Arab women than Arab men. Women reported that social media negatively affected their academic achievement, while men are found to be more addicted to social media platforms than them.\r\n\r\nAlzahrani and Alanzi (2019) also studied the impact of social media platforms on people with diabetes. They concluded that Saudi women prefer using WhatsApp and Twitter to gain better knowledge about their health and to keep in touch with their acquaintances. Similarly, Ahmed et al. (2018) found that Arab women prefer to use social media platforms such as Instagram or Facebook to socialize with friends and to spread information about brands, purchasing, and selling.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor Arab women, however, the use of social media is not limited to socializing, academia, or content searches. It has also become a key source of engagement for Arab women interested in sports. Ahmed and Thorpe (2020) show that female athletes using social media sites (i.e., Instagram and Facebook), have begun to challenge the stereotypes surrounding women in sports, significantly influencing female audiences to look for sports content, news, and sports events. Recently, social media posts related to female athletes have gone viral and have even been reposted by those with occupations not related to sports. The increasing participation in sports from Arab countries and its promotion on social media platforms has encouraged the region\u2019s domestic audiences to reexamine their cultural perception of sports, particularly women\u2019s sports. Additionally, sports role models and athletes featured on social media have encouraged Arab women to take an interest and consider participating in sports, thus breaking stereotypes and changing perceptions towards sports (AlKhalifa and Farello, 2021).\r\n\r\nThis examines the factors that motivate Arab women to use social media to follow sports as well as the role that social media plays developing their interest in sports. It also explicitly addresses the sports-related social media needs and interests of Arab women. Within media scholarship, there is limited research on Arab women\u2019s interest in sports, particularly in the GCC region. Thus, this subject deserves further exploration, and this research aims to fill that gap. The current study is based on uses and gratification theory, which explores how individuals use media for entertainment, information-seeking, socializing, and self-status aspects (Sheffer and Schultz 2014). It evaluates which of the aforementioned factors motivate Arab women and contribute to their interest in sports. The theory is discussed in the following section of the paper.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe study addresses the following research questions:\r\n\r\n \tWhich uses and gratification theory dimensions (entertainment, information-seeking, socializing, and self-status) significantly contribute to an interest in sports among female audiences in Arab countries?\u00a0\r\n \tWhich other needs and motivations, including access to content, accessibility, economics, education, and fan-ship, significantly impact the level of interest that Arab women have in sports?\r\n\r\nThe research paper also evaluates the demographic characteristics of Arab women with interests in sports, including their age, educational background, and employment status.\r\n\r\n \tDoes age significantly influence the extent of interest among Arab women in sports?\r\n \tDoes the extent of interest in sports among Arab women differ depending on education levels?\r\n \tDoes employment status significantly impact the level of interest Arab women have in sports?\r\n\r\nTheoretical and Empirical Evidence\r\nIn the context of social media and mass media, Blumler and Katz\u2019s (1973) theory of uses and gratification asserts that modern society is goal-oriented and actively seeks or uses media to achieve its goals. Through social media, members of society aim to fulfill their needs of gratification and desires as social media platforms enable individuals to engage, communicate, and maintain relationships (Sheffer and Schultz 2014). In the era of digital expansion, individuals using networking platforms can combine various platforms to achieve maximum gratification. In this realm, as discussed previously, social media also provides users a platform to voice their opinions and communicate their perceptions to a larger public audience (Hurley 2019). The users of media platforms are reliant on traditional mediums for accessing information regarding political, sports, and economic trends. Still, they have access to a combination of different platforms\u2014such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.\u2014where they can share, create, and seek information. Hence the uses and gratification theory allows researchers to evaluate how users meet their needs related to emotional connection, information-seeking, and status through social media (Froget et al. 2013).\u00a0\r\n\r\nBlumler and Katz (1973) initially divided media users\u2019 motivations into five groups: cognitive needs, social needs, personal needs, affection needs, and the need to relax. Modifying the theory, Park et al. (2009) reduced these categories into four gratification dimensions that relate to the usage of social media platforms. These dimensions include entertainment, information-seeking, socializing, and self-status aspects, which the current study employs in later sections.\r\n\r\nThe information-seeking aspect refers to individuals who satisfy their need for education and information on trends through media (Eginli and Tas 2018). The entertainment aspect concerns individuals who use a combination of social media platforms for entertainment and leisure. The socializing aspect relates to individuals who used the platform to interact, communicate, and engage with like-minded people in order to maintain and form new relationships while receiving societal acceptance and validation (Park et al. 2009). The self-status aspect relates to individuals who use social media platforms to add value and status to their lives.\u00a0\r\n\r\nConsequently, the role of social media has been considered positive in meeting the needs of individuals by enabling them to engage, be involved, and take an interest in different domains and fields, such as fashion, arts, media, politics, sports, and entertainment, etc. (Heinonen 2011; Kowalczyk and Pounders 2016; Yoo and Gretzel 2011). In this context, the current study uses these four social media dimensions of uses and gratification theory to test whether they are significant contributors to surveyed Arab females developing an interest in sports.\r\n\r\nAs discussed earlier, people are motivated to use social media for entertainment, profile-surfing, self-status development, and socializing with their family and friends (Brandtz\u00e6g and Heim 2009). Young Len-R\u00edos and Young (2017) found that female users in particular are motivated to use social media for entertainment, information, or news, and Plume and Slade (2018) noted that women in the UK are more likely to be influenced by relationship maintenance and social interaction, compared to men who are interested in seeking information from posts or videos, however, no significant difference is found between the men and women\u2019s behavioral intention for sharing sponsored advertisement (Plume and Slade 2018). Similarly, Shi et al. (2016) examined the effect of social media brand pages among users and found that women consider entertainment more favorable because it meets their emotional needs; therefore, they are motivated to use social media for continued social interactions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith its easy accessibility, social media has allowed users to access sports coverage and content globally and digital media has played a vital role in attracting viewers to sporting events. Around 60% of sports fans use social media to search for online sport updates or athletes' information due to its convenience and quick access (Creedon 2014). The platform creators themselves have also applied this information to conduct statistical analysis of user engagement. Billings et al. (2017), for example, found that Snapchat users in the US use the Snapchat app to follow sports or research sports-related information. While these surveyed fans used other platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook for social interaction and sports information, Snapchat was considered significantly helpful for facilitating an interest in sports among fans.\u00a0\r\n\r\nComparing these statistics to those in the Arab world, it has been noted that the use of Snapchat is also increasing among Arab users; in 2018, the company released the Arabic language version of the application encouraging millions to increase their usage (Radcliffe and Brune 2018). However, Snapchat usage for sports, particularly among Arabs, has not been given much attention.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the western world, platforms like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook have also been studied. For example, Meng et al. (2015) analyzed the types of content on Facebook and Twitter being produced by users in North America, and it has been observed that the National Basketball Association (NBA) delivered sports-related information to sports fans, thereby branding their communication. Meanwhile, female fans who use Twitter and Facebook take more interest in searching for information or posting content on these platforms during a game (Abdourazakou and Deng 2019).\r\n\r\nIn studies on media representations of women\u2019s athletics, however, Cooky et al. (2013) have noted that mainstream media covers women's sports less frequently than men's sports, thus marginalizing and silencing women athletes. Research conducted by Litchfield and Kavanagh (2019) examined the gender representation of sports athletes in social media coverage of the 2016 Olympic Games with a focus on Australian teams. The study found that males and females were represented differently on social media platforms. For instance, there were more \u2018active images\u2019 of male athletes compared to female ones. Another American-based study by Coche (2013) concluded that 72% of the articles on the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN) website and social media pages focused more on men\u2019s tennis compared to women's tennis (20%), while the remaining 8% were other stories about tennis as a sport. This lack of coverage has ultimately driven fan engagement on social media platforms and these platforms continue to play an important role in the promotion of women's sports and fan engagement (Vann 2014). Social media consumption has been positively linked with sports events and patronage, and female sports fans have been motivated to follow sports-related information and news on social media, and enjoy interacting with athletes' posts and purchasing their products (Hazari 2018).\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that scholars in the west have thoroughly explored and examined the sport-related content on social media and what motivates both genders to consume such type of content on different social media accounts. For example, French (2013) argued that most women consume sports-related content through social media platforms for the purposes of connecting with their close contacts, while men tend to engage with the sports content on social media mainly to identify with their favorite teams and engage in other sports-related activity.\r\n\r\nThe literature concerning the use of social media for sports among Arab women is still nascent. Studies examining the needs and motivations behind the consumption of sports-related content on social media among Arab women are still limited. Although many researchers have begun to view the use of social media in the Arab world as pivotal for garnering and developing sports acceptance locally, most studies have treated Arab women\u2019s social media use and Arab women\u2019s interest in sports as separate phenomena. Al-Jenaibi (2011) has observed that women from the UAE use social media for entertainment, business development, and gathering news. Similarly, Vieweg and Hodges (2016) have noted that Qatari women use social media for socializing and entertainment ends, such as posting photos and videos, giving and receiving likes, commenting, and gathering information. Similarly, Elareshi Ziani and Al Shami (2021) have highlighted how Bahraini women use social media to share information and spend an average of three hours daily on social media enjoying entertainment clips, comics, and reading news stories and content. Meanwhile, AlKhalifa and Farello (2021) have researched how women's football committees in GCC countries are using social media to create awareness about the sport, which has positively affected female fans. Theodorakis et al. (2017) have also found that Qatari women use social media to follow sport events and discuss sport-related information with friends and family.\r\n\r\nThis paper also examines how fan-ship (Witkemper et al., 2012) motivates female sports lovers to use different mediums, such as social media platforms, to form an emotional relationship with an athlete or team. Studies have also found that accessing sports through social media is popular among Qatari fans, as it was reported that 35% of female fans use social media for fan-ship or to follow sports-related content twice a week (Theodorakis et al. 2017). D'Andrea and Mintz (2019) have stated that social media users in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries consume sports for entertainment purposes and share sports-related memes, preferably on Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. Nabulsi (2014) found that Palestinian youth use social media to share football-related memes and relate them with their movement and cause. Monaghan (2014) noted that social media is increasingly used for football fan activism and meme creation.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis study lastly examines how demographic factors, such as education and occupation, impact Arab women in developing interest in sports-related social media content. Irem et al. (2014) have discussed how social media has become a key platform and source of information (e.g., education, entertainment, news, and sports) that has swept the traditional patriarchal culture in many of the Arab countries, thus allowing students to share their assignments and work with friends and classmates. Al\u2010Hamdan et al. (2021) add similar perspectives explaining that, while girls in Saudi Arabia are not provided with sports education or attend sports activities in public schools, they use social media to acquire education regarding physical activities and sports. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, this information-sharing has had a significant impact on physical education in Arab countries, as many schools put sports classes, assembly exercises, and other related work on hold (Al Lily et al., 2021). Thus, students relied on social media for their education.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile it can be argued that, irrespective of gender, several needs and motivations encourage people to use social media, limited studies have explored what factors influence Arab women to use social media for sports. This study attempts to address this gap through quantitative findings. Based on the literature, the current study also evaluates other needs and motivations behind Arab women\u2019s developing interest in sports along with the four dimensions of uses and gratification theory (Park et al. 2009). These include access to social media platforms (Creedon 2014), accessibility to content available on social media platforms which otherwise is not available on traditional communication mediums (Mohamed 2016), economic aspects, education (AI Lily et al. 2021; Hamdan et al. 2021) and \u2018fan-ship\u2019 (Witkemper et al. 2012; Woods and Butler 2020).\u00a0\r\nMethodology\r\nThis paper used a quantitative research methodology and a survey strategy. An online survey questionnaire was created on Google Forms and was filled out by 412 Arab women through social media platforms, email, and WhatsApp groups. One completely blank case was removed; therefore, the final sample size of the study was 411.\r\n\r\nA convenience sampling strategy was used in this paper to reach as many Arab women as possible. Participants were instructed to fill out the web survey about the dimensions of uses and gratification theory (information need, socializing, entertainment need, and self-status need) and other social media needs and motivations for sports as found in the literature (accessibility, economic aspect, \u2018fan-ship\u2019 aspect, education, and content accessibility aspect). These items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale as factors of latent independent variables. Meanwhile, the dependent variable of \u2018developing interest\u2019 was measured by gauging the level of awareness that Arab women have about sports events and trends around the world, as well as their perception of and attraction to sports-related content on social media. This was also measured using a 5-point Likert Scale.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe questionnaire was divided into four sections:\r\n\r\n \tThe first section measured respondents\u2019 demographic characteristics, including age, educational status, employment status, and country.\u00a0\r\n \tThe second section determined the hours they spent on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok.\u00a0\r\n \tThe third section of the survey included 5-point Likert Scale questions regarding the dimensions of uses and gratification theory and other needs and motivations of using social media.\r\n \tThe fourth section focused on respondents\u2019 awareness level, perception, and interests to measure the dependent variable through a 5-point Likert scale.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe researcher began the study by cleaning the data using MS Excel in order to perform a demographic analysis (frequency analysis) using SPSS 25.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the data was analyzed using Smart PLS, where partial least square path model (PLS-PM) was run to examine whether the independent variables (information, social need, entertainment need, and self-status need; accessibility impact, economic aspect, \u2018fan-ship\u2019 aspect, educational aspect and content accessibility aspect) significantly impacted the dependent variable (dependent variable). Further, IBM SPSS software was used to test the impact of demographic characteristics on the level of interest in sports that Arab women have developed over time.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBefore performing the PLS test and assessing relationships via other inferential tests, the researcher performed data quality checks, including reliability tests (Cronbach's alpha, rho A, composite reliability) and validity tests (AVE and discriminant validity). All tests were performed via Smart PLS 3.\r\nTable 1.

However, \u03b1 values greater than 0.5 were still considered acceptable (Taber, 2018). Moreover, the AVE of each variable was greater than the 0.5 threshold, which suggested adequate convergent validity (Ab Hamid et al., 2017).\u00a0\r\nTable 2.

The frequency analysis and descriptive statistics (in the later parts) are performed via SPSS 25. According to the data, most participants were 28 to 37 years old (29%), or 18 to 27 years (24.3%) at the time of the study. This information suggests that the research population was relatively young.\r\n\r\nIn terms of education, large numbers of Arab women either had a Bachelor's degree (23.8%) or a higher diploma (22.9%). 17.5% of the respondents also had a Master's degree. This information means that the population was well-educated.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdditionally, most Arab women who participated in the study were full-time employees (28.5%), followed by self-employed individuals (17.8%); 14.4% of the study's participants were unemployed.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith respect to country, 14.4% of the women were from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 7.3% were from Saudi Arabia, 6.1% were from Qatar, and 5.8% were from Bahrain. Overall, the study's sample represented 22 Arab countries, as shown in the above figure.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe study measured the time spent by Arab women on various social media platforms daily (on average).\r\nTable 4.

Table 4 also shows that most of the participants spent less than 2 hours daily on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. It lastly indicates that Snapchat\/TikTok are more frequently 'not used' among the social media platforms, while YouTube has 11.3% users (highest among the other platforms) who spend more than 4 hours daily on the platform.\u00a0\r\nDescriptive Statistics\u00a0\r\nAfter discussing the demographics and social media user behavior, authors studied the social media factors behind Arab women\u2019s motivation for sports-related social media engagement. These factors included all the dimensions of uses and gratification theory and other factors found in the literature that helped the researcher assess which motivation or need had the highest rating for women using the platforms.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 5.

with friends and colleagues\u201d (M = 4.37, SD = 0799), which correlates with the social interaction aspect of the uses and gratification theory. Hence, some Arab women are motivated to use social media for sports to fulfill social desires of engaging and maintaining relationships. This item was followed by another one that read, \u201cHaving my personal laptop\/mobile phone makes it easier for me to access and be present on social media platforms\u201d (M = 4.21, SD = 0.915), suggesting the importance of accessibility. The respondents also rated the items referring to 'usefulness' highly as they believed social media helped them gain new skills, learn new things, and access up-to-date information.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the \u201ceconomic aspect\u201d factor scored comparatively low. One of the social aspects, \u201cEveryone I know has used or uses social media platforms\u201d had the lowest mean score (M = 2.54, SD = 1.374). This score indicated that there were still individuals who did not use social media platforms.\r\n\r\nIn the same context of sports, Arab women mostly agreed that social media\u00a0 allows them to post their opinions to the world in a way that traditional media does not (M = 3.81, SD = 1.035). Social media also allows them to engage in conversations related to sports (M = 3.77, SD = 1.018), which points to the importance of the information-seeking aspect of the uses and gratification theory. Moreover, many women also considered the 'fan-ship reasons' important to their use, with a mean score of 3.77 each, such that most of the respondents follow athletes over social media because they are fans of athletes and sports in general.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe lowest mean scores pertained to the education\/academic context. The respondents had a similarly low mean score when social media was used for education\/job purposes. For instance, the item, \u201cI use social media for sports as a part of my job\u201d had a mean value equal to 2.65.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 6.

According to the mean scores, the respondents highly believed that Arab countries should encourage women\u2019s participation in sports (M = 3.91, SD = 1.201). Respondents also reported that they were aware of sporting events and championships (M = 3.79, SD = 0.961), such as the Qatar FIFA World Cup 2022 (M = 3.77, SD = 1.116). These scores mean that, overall, the level of awareness regarding sports was high among the surveyed Arab women, and that their interest in sports was increasing.\r\n\r\nConsidering the study's aim ( i.e., evaluating the impact of social media on a developing interest in sports among Arab female audiences), researcher presents a PLS path model below.\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Impact of Uses and Gratification Factors and Social Media Needs and Motivation Factors on the Level of Interest Developed Among Arab Women.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the above model, the researcher examines the impact of the different dimensions of the uses and gratification theory (information, social need, entertainment-seeking and self-status need) and the aforementioned aspects found in the literature (accessibility impact, economic aspect, \u2018fan-ship\u2019 aspect, educational aspect and content accessibility aspect) on the extent of Arab women\u2019s interest in sports (awareness, interest, and perspective).\r\nTable 7.

A value less than 0.08 is considered a good fit. Here, the model indicates a good fit since the SRMR value was less than 0.08. Moreover, the NFI value was close to 1, which also suggests a good fit. Overall, the model shows a 68.1% variance in the dependent variable (see figure 3).\u00a0\r\nTable 8.

The p-values reveal that access to content, fan-ship, and information-seeking were statistically significant motivations in explaining the extent of interest in sports at 0.01 level. Economic aspects were significant at 0.05 level, while accessibility and entertainment were significant at 0.1 level in predicting the extent of interest in sports among Arab women.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe researcher also observed that all significant variables played a positive role in developing interest in sports since the beta coefficient was positive in all cases. Among social media needs and motivations, accessibility, access to content, fan-ship, and economic aspects were significant, while in the context of uses and gratification theory dimensions, entertainment and information were statistically significant.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis data means that greater access to content, greater accessibility, economic benefits, greater entertainment, fan-ship, and more information contributed to the development of an interest in sports among Arab women.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe study also evaluates the relationships between Arab females\u2019 demographic characteristics and the extent of their interest in sports. First, this research study evaluates whether age significantly influenced the extent of interest among Arab women in sports.\u00a0\r\nTable 9.

The mean difference is significant at the 0.05 level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the one-way ANOVA results, there was a significant difference in the extent of interest in sports among different age groups (F = 12.509, p &lt; 0.001). In other words, the age of the respondents played a significant role in their developing interest in sports.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe multiple comparisons between the groups suggest that the oldest age group of the study (i.e., above 57 years old Arab females), had a significantly lower score in the \u2018extent of interest in sports\u2019 than the younger groups. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the interest in sports between the other groups. However, the younger age groups still had a greater interest in sports than their older counterparts; for example, the 18 to 27 years old age group had the highest average extent of interest in sports.\u00a0\r\nTable 10.

The mean difference is significant at the 0.05 level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, the author performed another ANOVA test to assess the link between employment and interest in sports. Overall, employment status significantly impacted the level of interest that the surveyed Arab women have in sports (F = 15.284, p &lt; 0.001).\r\n\r\nIndividually, self-employed Arab women were most interested in sports, as indicated by the fact that they had the highest mean score in the extent of interest in sports, followed by full-time and part-time employees. Moreover, the unemployed and \u2018other\u2019 employment status groups (such as women who were retired, housewives, etc.) had a significantly low mean interest in sports than the other groups.\u00a0\r\nDiscussion\r\nIn discussing the results from the lens of existing theories and reviewed literature, the findings align with the theories of social media put forward in the introduction. Before evaluating whether social media has been effective in driving the interest of female audiences in sports, it is important to shed light on the aspects motivating Arab women to use social media in general. For example, the descriptive statistics (See Table 5) indicated that the majority of the women surveyed were attracted or convinced to use social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc., because these platforms helped them to socially connect with friends and colleagues. These statistics suggest that women from Arab countries mostly use social media platforms to fulfill their social needs. It allows them to socialize with other people for the purpose of building and maintaining quality social relationships and enhancing social interactions. This is supported by the findings of another study that justified Arab women\u2019s use of social media for social and personal reasons as it helps them keep in touch with friends. (Alzahrani and Alzani 2019)\r\n\r\nLikewise, women in western societies use social media to keep in touch and maintain relationships with their social connections. Park et al. (2009) as well as Plume and Slade, (2018) argue that women use social media platforms to expand their social circles and to interact and communicate with like-minded people.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnother significant dimension in the uses and gratification theory that was linked with the consumption of sports-related content on social media was the entertainment-seeking dimension. (Witkemper et al. 2012) The entertainment dimension of the uses and gratification theory shows that Arab females are motivated to use different types of social media accounts during their leisure time as well (Park et al. 2009).\u00a0\r\n\r\nApart from uses and gratification dimensions, most users following sports through social media outlets use these platforms to access content that is not available on traditional media and that allows them to voice their opinions and engage in conversations about sports (See Table 5). For example, in studies by Plume and Slade (2018) and Ahmed and Thorpe (2020), researchers identified the same behavior among women asserting that most women who used social media in the context of sports chose to share their views and engage in conversations related to sports or politics from which they might otherwise have been restricted.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the causal analysis the results showed that out of the four uses and gratification theory\u2019s dimensions, entertainment-seeking and information-seeking aspects of social media had a statistically significant impact on Arab women\u2019s developing interest in sports. However, other uses and gratification dimensions, such as social and self-status-seeking motivations, have had an insignificant impact on Arab women\u2019s interest in sports. Furthermore, social media usage aspects, such as economic aspects and accessibility, were significant and positively contributed towards developing and enhancing the interest of Arab women in sports (See Table 8). The findings correlate with the literature put forward by Creedon (2014), who explains that digital media can significantly impact people\u2019s interests and preferences due to its global accessibility.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdditionally, based on the fact that the most common uses of social media (such as access to better content, informative news, and entertaining content) are significant factors for Arab females developing more of an interest in sports, this study further supports the findings of Rajakumar (2021); Theodorakis et al. (2017); Creedon (2014); Irem et al. (2014), and Hull et al. (2019). These authors discuss the key role that social media platforms play in influencing and changing audiences' perception of and level of interest in sports by making people aware of the current sporting trends and events around the world (Theodorakis et al. 2017). Overall, the results confirm that the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others, are playing a significant role in Arab women\u2019s interest in sports. The results also confirm that Arab women\u2019s demographic characteristics, such as age groups, educational level, and employment status, play a significant role in impacting their interest in sports.\u00a0\r\n\r\nEven though the results of the current study provide valuable findings and contribute to the research gap identified, the chosen methodology and techniques may have limited a holistic understanding of the relationship between Arab women and sports-related social media content. For example, considering that the impact of social media on female audiences\u2019 interest in sports is a relatively new topic in the Arab region, a qualitative analysis via interviews could have provided in-depth and detailed results.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMoreover, although the PLS path model is a value-added analysis, it limits the present study\u2019s analytical scope. For example, content analysis techniques via social media platforms\u2014such as Facebook comments, Twitter tweets, and Instagram posts or stories\u2014could have helped broaden the current study's scope by helping researchers identify how women engage with sports-related content and how social media influences their perception of, knowledge of, and interest in sports. Finally, the limitations of the sample size should also be considered, the surveyed population is too small to generalize or draw conclusions on strong themes about the Arab region in its entirety.\u00a0\r\nConclusion\r\nThe objective of the current research paper is to determine the impact of social media in developing Arab women\u2019s interests in sports. It observed that social media play a significant role in increasing visibility and driving online engagement regarding sports among Arab women.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis study specifically focused on the way Arab women use social media in sports. Based on a sample of 411 Arab females, the study finds that access to content, fan-ship, and information-seeking reasons are the most important motivations that explain why Arab women consume sports content on social media platforms.\r\n\r\nEconomic, accessibility, and entertainment aspects significantly predict interest in sports among Arab women. Moreover, social media needs and motivations have a positive impact on the level of interests developed among Arab women.\r\n\r\nDemographic factors significantly influence the extent of interests in sports among Arab women. According to the results of this study, Arab women who are self-employed, young and have a bachelor\u2019s degree are more interested in sports than women who have other demographic characteristics. These findings suggest that social media could be used effectively to raise awareness and develop interests in different types of sports among Arab women.\u00a0\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"",""image"":{""@type"":""ImageObject"",""url"":""https:\/\/www.arabmediasociety.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Medalists_at_the_Womens_57_kg_Taekwando.jpeg"",""width"":800,""height"":533}}</script> </article><div class=""footnotes""><p dir=""ltr""><span>References</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Ab Hamid, M.

Society</em> hosted a virtual panel discussion titled “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLIhBdhyXU"">Arab Media Between Conflict &amp; Peace</a>.” Following the panel, Managing Editor Sarah El-Shaarawi spoke with panelist Dr. Sahar Khamis about her co-edited volume <em>Arab Women’s Activism and Socio-Political Transformation: Unfinished </em><em>Gendered Revolutions</em> (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018). The volume combines diverse perspectives from across the region and beyond, unpacking the emergent and evolving forms of gendered activisms and feminisms, and complicating the narratives. Edited in collaboration with Dr. Amel Mili (bios below), Dr. Khamis shares how the book came together, what it contributes to the literature on regional feminist and media studies, and how it fits into the current sociocultural moment of an ever-changing Arab world.</p><p>SE:  Where did the idea of this book project come from?</p><p>SK: The book’s idea was a product of my deliberations with my co-editor, Dr. Amel Mili, who is Tunisian-American. She was a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania back in 2015, and I was a visiting scholar with the Annenberg School of Communication there at the same time. We met at one of the events at the University of Pennsylvania. She said, ‘I have a book project that I'm putting together, and I need a good co-editor.’ It was a big undertaking, because we had many contributors, but we both agreed to rise up to the challenge.</p><p>SE: What was the process of putting this book together like?</p><p>SK: Of course, like everything else, it does have its pros and cons, but, overall, it was a great eye-opening experience. Whenever you're co-editing someone else’s work, you're being exposed to all of these different views and perspectives, some of which you're going to agree with, and some of which you won’t. You just have to do your job of being a good editor, and not interfering in the content. As an editor, I had to completely detach myself from what I was reading. So, whether I agree with you or disagree with you, I still have to read the manuscript with utmost respect for your views, because they are your views, not mine. Just grappling with this idea of coming across different content, which I did not always personally agree with, was a learning moment for me. You have to really exercise some kind of self-restraint, as an editor, to maintain your professionalism and to preserve the integrity and neutrality of the editing process.</p><p>SE: What are the main takeaways from the book? And how is feminism defined throughout?</p><p>SK: I think that the book makes a number of important contributions to the field of Arab media, in general, and the field of gendered activism and feminist activism in the Arab world, in particular. One of the important takeaways is the plurality and multiplicity of gendered identities within the Arab region. There is never a “one size fits all” when it comes to thinking about the issue of activism, which is why we should use the term “activisms” in the plural. The same thing with “feminisms,” there is never a “one size fits all” type of feminism, which is, again, why we should use it in the plural. This is not just applicable when we compare Arab women to Western women, for example. It is also applicable when we compare women from different parts of the Arab world. We have to steer away from the whole notion of imposing some kind of pre-prepared, pre-packaged form of Western feminism. Rather, we have to create our own homemade feminist recipe. When you buy a package off the shelf, it's already pre-prepared, right? It's very different in terms of taste, flavor, and nutrition compared to something you cook at home. That's how I like to think about the phenomenon of feminism. We should try to always create our own homemade recipes of multiple feminisms, which should be contextualized within our own cultural, social, political, and socio-economic realities, which, of course, are different, not just between the West and the East or the Western world and the Arab world, but even within, and across, different Arab countries.</p><p>SE: And what about the authors? Who contributed to this volume and how were they selected?</p><p>SK: There are 11 chapters in this volume. It's very interesting that we have contributors from different Arab countries, as well as non-Arab countries, in addition to the plethora of topics that are tackled. For example, there are authors who wrote about Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt. So, the diversity of the Arab countries which were examined in this volume is awesome, but so is the diversity of the contributors to the volume. We have, for example, an American contributor and a contributor from Japan, and also—most notably—a male contributor, who wrote an excellent chapter on Morocco. I have always believed in both the “insider’s knowledge” and the “outsider’s gaze.” The “insider’s knowledge” means that you have to acknowledge the value and expertise of the indigenous voices coming from within the Arab region; but you also have to take into account the “outsider’s gaze,” which refers to the perspectives of outsiders, that are equally important. This is because if you visit different countries, you are going to see things that those who are living inside each country cannot see themselves. So, we strive in this volume to create some kind of balance and equilibrium, through creating a cross-fertilization of the “outsider’s gaze” and the “insider’s knowledge.” Equally important, is the fact that we do not turn a blind eye to the significance of having male allies, who can support women’s issues and express solidarity with their causes.</p><p>SE: It is definitely important to have a diversity of voices. Can you give some specific examples of what we will find in the volume?</p><p>SK: Both myself and my co-editor strongly believe that men are also gendered beings. Therefore, we cannot just think of gender as confined to women only, because every human being has a gendered identity. Men who are feminists can be strong allies for women. So why should we sideline them, or, even worse, think of them as enemies? To that effect, I'll say that one of the contributors, Dr. Brahim El Guabli, wrote an excellent chapter about Moroccan women and their activism, and he described how they suffered from so many different challenges and hardships. There is also diversity across different countries and cultures. For example, one of the interesting chapters in this volume was written by a Japanese author, Namie Tsujigami, about the driving ban in Saudi Arabia. Of course, the driving ban has been lifted since the book’s publication. However, she was trying to complicate the issue by adding much-needed nuance to the often simplistic representation of the driving ban. For example, she interviewed some Saudi women who didn’t want to be bothered with the burden of driving, and, therefore, they were perfectly alright with the driving ban. This reminds me of the misinformed and stereotypical discussions about the veil, the <em>hijab</em>, which is a popular topic that people, especially in the West, always like to tackle. People might think, “Oh my god, the veil is restrictive and it's very suppressive.” Well, guess what? It can be very liberating, when it is your personal choice, and it can even be a symbol of resistance, when you fight for it. In other words, it could never be seen in black and white terms.</p><p>SE: How did the political upheavals and socio-political changes in the region throughout the last decade or so impact the topics covered in this volume?</p><p>SK: People mistakenly believe that Arab women's activism is confined to the Arab Spring moment. The Arab Spring, undoubtedly, brought about fantastic images of young women going out in the streets chanting slogans, side by side with men, and they did not just play a “supplementary role” in terms of being the caretakers and the nurturers of men. Rather, Arab women were at the frontlines of resistance themselves, putting their own lives at risk, and risking harassment, rape, imprisonment, or even being killed, and some of them, indeed, became martyrs. But as much as this is a glorious moment, and a very important one, the volume also gives you a more detailed account of the different phases, and faces, of Arab women’s activisms and feminisms in the region, which extended before, during, and after the Arab Spring uprisings. You have the phase prior to the Arab Spring, which was characterized by “top-down, tokenistic feminism,” that did not trickle down sufficiently to wider segments of women in Arab societies. What the Arab Spring brought about was a shift from this type of “top-down feminism” to a much more grassroots “bottom-up feminism” that comes from women themselves. Then you move to the post-Arab Spring phase, with all of its challenges and derailments in the process of democratization, which was paralleled by an increasingly shrinking margin of freedom, in general, and press freedom, in particular. All of these constraints, which were imposed in both the political and the mediated spheres simultaneously, in a number of post-Arab Spring countries had dire implications on Arab women’s activism, as discussed in numerous chapters in this volume.</p><p>SE: Can you provide some specific examples of this type of feminist activism and its challenges?</p><p>SK: In my co-authored chapter in the volume with Bahraini journalist, Nada Alwadi, we talked about the constraints that women in Bahrain had to endure as a result of the suppression of the uprising and the stifling of freedom in their country, which, therefore, meant that they were not able to exercise a lot of freedoms, like the ability to really engage in some kind of activism on the ground. Many of them started to flee the country and to live in self-imposed exile in the diaspora for their own safety and the safety of their families. Of course, there are other Arab countries suffering from similar phenomena, including the derailment in democratization and the stifling of freedoms. This meant that, in many cases, even the online space is not safe anymore. For women, in particular, that becomes even more dangerous, because they become subjected to online shaming, character assassination, smearing, and stigmatization, which are particularly more destructive and dangerous for women in conservative, traditional societies.</p><p>SE: I agree with a lot of what you are saying, but I feel like your outlook is a little pessimistic, because of the sort of shift we have witnessing over the last few years, partially because of Egypt's #MeToo moment. Some of it was a disaster, but not all of it was. There are now online platforms that call people out, and there are new laws, which, in some cases, have been successfully implemented. So, I do feel like there are reasons to be pessimistic, but I also feel like we've seen some positive changes lately. And, yes, with respect to the higher risk women face online, we should never underestimate it. The real impact that this type of cyberbullying has on women's lives is completely underrepresented and underplayed.</p><p>SK: I totally agree. Definitely, new online initiatives, such as the anti-sexual harassment campaigns, have been very effective in the Arab region lately. In fact, one of the chapters in this edited volume, written by Nahed Eltantawy, tackles the anti-sexual harassment movement, especially in Egypt. She talks about mobile applications, like <em>Shoft Taharosh</em> (I have seen harassment) and HarassMap, and others which try to locate the harassers and pinpoint them to show people where the dangerous areas are, and where there's a high risk of sexual harassment. Women really mobilized not just for political purposes, but also for social purposes. There is this so-called “double jeopardy,” which means that women are fighting the political struggle, side by side with men, but they are also fighting a social struggle on top of it. In other words, if you are an Arab woman, you are not just struggling for freedom and democracy, rather, you are also struggling to get recognized and to achieve gender equity and equal pay. You need to have a place at the table and to be respected socially, which includes speaking in the public sphere, running for office, getting elected, remaining safe, and being protected from any kind of violence or harm, both online and offline.</p><p>SE: A lot of this requires not just action on the ground, but also changes in the legal system as well. How is this addressed in the volume?</p><p>SK: Absolutely, and that is another important theme in this book. My co-editor, Dr. Amel Mili, is Tunisian-American and she was a judge back in Tunisia. People rarely talk about laws, but laws are very important. The book focuses on three parallel struggles that Arab women are constantly grappling with; the political struggle against autocracy and dictatorship, the social struggle against patriarchy and stagnant social traditions, and the legal struggle against discriminatory laws. Most importantly, there is also a negative societal mindset around women's issues; which tends to underestimate the significance of these issues. This is evident in common statements, such as: “Let's take care of the country first, and then we can pay attention to women's issues later,” as if women are not part of society. Women are half of society, and they give birth to the second half. Therefore, ignoring them and turning a blind eye to their interests is always detrimental. We have to admit that when you're living in a patriarchal society, unfortunately, women's issues are oftentimes completely ignored, or they're not given sufficient attention.</p><p>In her chapter in the volume, my co-editor, Dr. Amel Mili, unpacks these three struggles from the Tunisian perspective, informed by her background as an administrative judge in Tunisia. She also raises attention on this particular point about the legal aspects. The chapter discusses Tunisia as the cradle of the Arab Spring, examines gender rights in Tunisia, and why Tunisian women have been enjoying greater freedoms compared to the rest of the Arab world. One of the reasons is literacy. The literacy rate among Tunisian women is much higher than in other parts of the region. More women are educated and are afforded better educational opportunities, but also more women are on the bench (are judges), and that's a very important thing because then they can replace some of the negative laws, and can enact new laws, for example the domestic violence or gender-based violence law that was established in Tunisia. This became a success model, because it did not just define gender-based violence as domestic violence inside the home, but rather, as a societal issue, which is really holistic and comprehensive. If women are denied a job because of their gender, it is economic violence; if they face job discrimination, it's economic violence; if they're not able to run for office or to be elected, it’s political violence. So, it took the issue of gender-based violence out of the domestic sphere into a much more public, comprehensive, and holistic sphere.</p><p>SE: The book also discusses the important concept of Arab women’s invisibility. Can you elaborate on this point?</p><p>SK: The book talks about three levels of invisibility that Arab women have been struggling and grappling with. There's invisibility in the academic sphere, where there is not enough literature on Arab women's activism and gendered resistances. Indeed, this book is hoping to fill some of these gaps and help to contribute to this particular area, to bring more attention to this blind spot of underrepresentation in academic literature in terms of women's gendered activisms and resistances. And then you have invisibility in the socio-economic sphere. Women are working long hours, they're not paid to work, and it’s by and large undocumented. These women are viewed as housewives, when in fact, they are contributing tremendously to the economy. Finally, you have invisibility in the media, where images of women do not tend to convey reality. The majority are skewed misrepresentations and stereotypical images. In many cases they are negative images, which show women as repressed or suppressed, as weak, or excluded from decision-making. Additionally, they also become overly sexualized objects, like belly dancers or mistresses without agency. The book tries to defy these three levels of women’s invisibility: academic, socio-economic, and representations in the media.</p><p>SE: I want to ask you about the inclusion of men in feminist discourse. In the Western world, the inclusion of men, or having men as allies of feminist movements in general has become more common. I'm wondering if you've noticed a difference in how that inclusion is taken on, or perceived. How welcome it is within both regions: the West and the Arab region?</p><p>SK: Dr. Brahim El Guabli, who contributed the chapter on Morocco, is Moroccan-American, so he has a foot in each world and acts as a good bridge, not just between genders, but also between different cultures. However, the question is about acceptability: How is society accepting this notion of talking about women's issues and having men who are feminists? Feminism, unfortunately, is still seen as a dirty word. People tend not to understand the term feminism and correlate it with women who are rebellious, unethical, and immoral. I think this misconception is universal, but gets worse in the Arab/Muslim world. This is something we need to work on as a society, to make people understand that feminism is not a dirty word. Feminism is about women's rights, and women should have a place at the table. If you don't have a place at the table, you will be on the menu. Women have been on the menu for a long time. I think that the idea of having male allies is still not very much the norm because there's still not enough understanding and appreciation of it. This is the case either because of those who think that women's issues should only be addressed and tackled by women, or because the idea of having a male at the table is frowned upon. Men are fathers, they are husbands, they are partners, they are sons, they are brothers, they are colleagues, they are co-workers. If you try to say, “Okay, I'm not going to deal with them, they are the enemy.” How helpful is that going to be?</p><p>SE: What has changed since the book’s publication and what has stayed the same?</p><p>SK: When you talk about the things that were not covered in the book, of course, some things have changed [since publication]. Like I said, Dr. Tsujigami, who wrote about the driving ban in Saudi Arabia, that, of course, has changed with the driving ban being lifted. The guardianship law has also been modified and changed. These moves, however, did not create a shift in societal mindset sufficiently. As I’ve mentioned, laws are very important, but they're not sufficient on their own. How are people looking at women who are driving? Are they welcoming them or not? You cannot erase years of a heavy, rigid, and very traditional interpretation of religion overnight. It's not going to happen. That can take years and years of work, starting from the new generation, in order to change.</p><p>The #MeToo movement and anti-harassment campaigns really grew and spread after the publication of the book. The book talks about some of the early phases of these efforts, but now, there is more resonance on social media, and there are more campaigns. There is also the very important point about COVID-19, which, of course, happened in 2020 after the book was published. COVID-19 had negative impacts on everyone, but it had an even worse impact on women in particular. Many women lost their jobs, lost their support systems, not to mention the increasing digital divide, which became much worse for women in the Arab world. So, if we were to edit another volume of this book, we would account for all of these new developments, which took place in the Arab region and the world at large, and study their effects and implications on Arab women.</p><p>For more read <a href=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/info-deficiency-in-an-infodemic-the-gender-digital-gap-arab-women-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/"">Info-Deficiency in an Infodemic: The Gender Digital Gap, Arab Women and the COVID-19 Pandemic</a>, by Dr. Sahar Khamis and Eliza Campbell.</p><p><strong><em><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-7008 alignleft"" data-lazy-sizes=""(max-width: 171px) 100vw, 171px"" data-lazy-src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sahar-Khamis-Picture-1-300x300.jpg"" data-lazy-srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sahar-Khamis-Picture-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sahar-Khamis-Picture-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sahar-Khamis-Picture-1.jpg 550w"" height=""171"" src=""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20171%20171'%3E%3C/svg%3E"" width=""171""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-7008 alignleft"" height=""171"" sizes=""(max-width: 171px) 100vw, 171px"" src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sahar-Khamis-Picture-1-300x300.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sahar-Khamis-Picture-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sahar-Khamis-Picture-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sahar-Khamis-Picture-1.jpg 550w"" width=""171""/></noscript>Sahar Khamis</em></strong><em> is an Associate Professor in the Department of Communication and an Affiliate Professor of Women’s Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park.

The volume combines diverse perspectives from across the region and beyond, unpacking the emergent and evolving forms of gendered activisms and feminisms, and complicating the narratives. Edited in collaboration with Dr. Amel Mili (bios below), Dr. Khamis shares how the book came together, what it contributes to the literature on regional feminist and media studies, and how it fits into the current sociocultural moment of an ever-changing Arab world.\r\n\r\nSE:\u00a0 Where did the idea of this book project come from?\r\n\r\nSK: The book\u2019s idea was a product of my deliberations with my co-editor, Dr. Amel Mili, who is Tunisian-American. She was a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania back in 2015, and I was a visiting scholar with the Annenberg School of Communication there at the same time. We met at one of the events at the University of Pennsylvania. She said, \u2018I have a book project that I'm putting together, and I need a good co-editor.\u2019 It was a big undertaking, because we had many contributors, but we both agreed to rise up to the challenge.\r\n\r\nSE: What was the process of putting this book together like?\r\n\r\nSK: Of course, like everything else, it does have its pros and cons, but, overall, it was a great eye-opening experience. Whenever you're co-editing someone else\u2019s work, you're being exposed to all of these different views and perspectives, some of which you're going to agree with, and some of which you won\u2019t. You just have to do your job of being a good editor, and not interfering in the content. As an editor, I had to completely detach myself from what I was reading. So, whether I agree with you or disagree with you, I still have to read the manuscript with utmost respect for your views, because they are your views, not mine. Just grappling with this idea of coming across different content, which I did not always personally agree with, was a learning moment for me. You have to really exercise some kind of self-restraint, as an editor, to maintain your professionalism and to preserve the integrity and neutrality of the editing process.\r\n\r\nSE: What are the main takeaways from the book? And how is feminism defined throughout?\r\n\r\nSK: I think that the book makes a number of important contributions to the field of Arab media, in general, and the field of gendered activism and feminist activism in the Arab world, in particular. One of the important takeaways is the plurality and multiplicity of gendered identities within the Arab region. There is never a \u201cone size fits all\u201d when it comes to thinking about the issue of activism, which is why we should use the term \u201cactivisms\u201d in the plural. The same thing with \u201cfeminisms,\u201d there is never a \u201cone size fits all\u201d type of feminism, which is, again, why we should use it in the plural. This is not just applicable when we compare Arab women to Western women, for example. It is also applicable when we compare women from different parts of the Arab world. We have to steer away from the whole notion of imposing some kind of pre-prepared, pre-packaged form of Western feminism. Rather, we have to create our own homemade feminist recipe. When you buy a package off the shelf, it's already pre-prepared, right? It's very different in terms of taste, flavor, and nutrition compared to something you cook at home. That's how I like to think about the phenomenon of feminism. We should try to always create our own homemade recipes of multiple feminisms, which should be contextualized within our own cultural, social, political, and socio-economic realities, which, of course, are different, not just between the West and the East or the Western world and the Arab world, but even within, and across, different Arab countries.\r\n\r\nSE: And what about the authors? Who contributed to this volume and how were they selected?\r\n\r\nSK: There are 11 chapters in this volume. It's very interesting that we have contributors from different Arab countries, as well as non-Arab countries, in addition to the plethora of topics that are tackled. For example, there are authors who wrote about Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt. So, the diversity of the Arab countries which were examined in this volume is awesome, but so is the diversity of the contributors to the volume. We have, for example, an American contributor and a contributor from Japan, and also\u2014most notably\u2014a male contributor, who wrote an excellent chapter on Morocco. I have always believed in both the \u201cinsider\u2019s knowledge\u201d and the \u201coutsider\u2019s gaze.\u201d The \u201cinsider\u2019s knowledge\u201d means that you have to acknowledge the value and expertise of the indigenous voices coming from within the Arab region; but you also have to take into account the \u201coutsider\u2019s gaze,\u201d which refers to the perspectives of outsiders, that are equally important. This is because if you visit different countries, you are going to see things that those who are living inside each country cannot see themselves. So, we strive in this volume to create some kind of balance and equilibrium, through creating a cross-fertilization of the \u201coutsider\u2019s gaze\u201d and the \u201cinsider\u2019s knowledge.\u201d Equally important, is the fact that we do not turn a blind eye to the significance of having male allies, who can support women\u2019s issues and express solidarity with their causes.\r\n\r\nSE: It is definitely important to have a diversity of voices. Can you give some specific examples of what we will find in the volume?\r\n\r\nSK: Both myself and my co-editor strongly believe that men are also gendered beings. Therefore, we cannot just think of gender as confined to women only, because every human being has a gendered identity. Men who are feminists can be strong allies for women. So why should we sideline them, or, even worse, think of them as enemies? To that effect, I'll say that one of the contributors, Dr. Brahim El Guabli, wrote an excellent chapter about Moroccan women and their activism, and he described how they suffered from so many different challenges and hardships. There is also diversity across different countries and cultures. For example, one of the interesting chapters in this volume was written by a Japanese author, Namie Tsujigami, about the driving ban in Saudi Arabia. Of course, the driving ban has been lifted since the book\u2019s publication. However, she was trying to complicate the issue by adding much-needed nuance to the often simplistic representation of the driving ban. For example, she interviewed some Saudi women who didn\u2019t want to be bothered with the burden of driving, and, therefore, they were perfectly alright with the driving ban. This reminds me of the misinformed and stereotypical discussions about the veil, the hijab, which is a popular topic that people, especially in the West, always like to tackle. People might think, \u201cOh my god, the veil is restrictive and it's very suppressive.\u201d Well, guess what? It can be very liberating, when it is your personal choice, and it can even be a symbol of resistance, when you fight for it. In other words, it could never be seen in black and white terms.\r\n\r\nSE: How did the political upheavals and socio-political changes in the region throughout the last decade or so impact the topics covered in this volume?\r\n\r\nSK: People mistakenly believe that Arab women's activism is confined to the Arab Spring moment. The Arab Spring, undoubtedly, brought about fantastic images of young women going out in the streets chanting slogans, side by side with men, and they did not just play a \u201csupplementary role\u201d in terms of being the caretakers and the nurturers of men. Rather, Arab women were at the frontlines of resistance themselves, putting their own lives at risk, and risking harassment, rape, imprisonment, or even being killed, and some of them, indeed, became martyrs. But as much as this is a glorious moment, and a very important one, the volume also gives you a more detailed account of the different phases, and faces, of Arab women\u2019s activisms and feminisms in the region, which extended before, during, and after the Arab Spring uprisings. You have the phase prior to the Arab Spring, which was characterized by \u201ctop-down, tokenistic feminism,\u201d that did not trickle down sufficiently to wider segments of women in Arab societies. What the Arab Spring brought about was a shift from this type of \u201ctop-down feminism\u201d to a much more grassroots \u201cbottom-up feminism\u201d that comes from women themselves. Then you move to the post-Arab Spring phase, with all of its challenges and derailments in the process of democratization, which was paralleled by an increasingly shrinking margin of freedom, in general, and press freedom, in particular. All of these constraints, which were imposed in both the political and the mediated spheres simultaneously, in a number of post-Arab Spring countries had dire implications on Arab women\u2019s activism, as discussed in numerous chapters in this volume.\r\n\r\nSE: Can you provide some specific examples of this type of feminist activism and its challenges?\r\n\r\nSK: In my co-authored chapter in the volume with Bahraini journalist, Nada Alwadi, we talked about the constraints that women in Bahrain had to endure as a result of the suppression of the uprising and the stifling of freedom in their country, which, therefore, meant that they were not able to exercise a lot of freedoms, like the ability to really engage in some kind of activism on the ground. Many of them started to flee the country and to live in self-imposed exile in the diaspora for their own safety and the safety of their families. Of course, there are other Arab countries suffering from similar phenomena, including the derailment in democratization and the stifling of freedoms. This meant that, in many cases, even the online space is not safe anymore. For women, in particular, that becomes even more dangerous, because they become subjected to online shaming, character assassination, smearing, and stigmatization, which are particularly more destructive and dangerous for women in conservative, traditional societies.\r\n\r\nSE: I agree with a lot of what you are saying, but I feel like your outlook is a little pessimistic, because of the sort of shift we have witnessing over the last few years, partially because of Egypt's #MeToo moment. Some of it was a disaster, but not all of it was. There are now online platforms that call people out, and there are new laws, which, in some cases, have been successfully implemented. So, I do feel like there are reasons to be pessimistic, but I also feel like we've seen some positive changes lately. And, yes, with respect to the higher risk women face online, we should never underestimate it. The real impact that this type of cyberbullying has on women's lives is completely underrepresented and underplayed.\r\n\r\nSK: I totally agree. Definitely, new online initiatives, such as the anti-sexual harassment campaigns, have been very effective in the Arab region lately. In fact, one of the chapters in this edited volume, written by Nahed Eltantawy, tackles the anti-sexual harassment movement, especially in Egypt. She talks about mobile applications, like Shoft Taharosh (I have seen harassment) and HarassMap, and others which try to locate the harassers and pinpoint them to show people where the dangerous areas are, and where there's a high risk of sexual harassment. Women really mobilized not just for political purposes, but also for social purposes. There is this so-called \u201cdouble jeopardy,\u201d which means that women are fighting the political struggle, side by side with men, but they are also fighting a social struggle on top of it. In other words, if you are an Arab woman, you are not just struggling for freedom and democracy, rather, you are also struggling to get recognized and to achieve gender equity and equal pay. You need to have a place at the table and to be respected socially, which includes speaking in the public sphere, running for office, getting elected, remaining safe, and being protected from any kind of violence or harm, both online and offline.\r\n\r\nSE: A lot of this requires not just action on the ground, but also changes in the legal system as well. How is this addressed in the volume?\r\n\r\nSK: Absolutely, and that is another important theme in this book. My co-editor, Dr. Amel Mili, is Tunisian-American and she was a judge back in Tunisia. People rarely talk about laws, but laws are very important. The book focuses on three parallel struggles that Arab women are constantly grappling with; the political struggle against autocracy and dictatorship, the social struggle against patriarchy and stagnant social traditions, and the legal struggle against discriminatory laws. Most importantly, there is also a negative societal mindset around women's issues; which tends to underestimate the significance of these issues. This is evident in common statements, such as: \u201cLet's take care of the country first, and then we can pay attention to women's issues later,\u201d as if women are not part of society. Women are half of society, and they give birth to the second half. Therefore, ignoring them and turning a blind eye to their interests is always detrimental. We have to admit that when you're living in a patriarchal society, unfortunately, women's issues are oftentimes completely ignored, or they're not given sufficient attention.\r\n\r\nIn her chapter in the volume, my co-editor, Dr. Amel Mili, unpacks these three struggles from the Tunisian perspective, informed by her background as an administrative judge in Tunisia. She also raises attention on this particular point about the legal aspects. The chapter discusses Tunisia as the cradle of the Arab Spring, examines gender rights in Tunisia, and why Tunisian women have been enjoying greater freedoms compared to the rest of the Arab world. One of the reasons is literacy. The literacy rate among Tunisian women is much higher than in other parts of the region. More women are educated and are afforded better educational opportunities, but also more women are on the bench (are judges), and that's a very important thing because then they can replace some of the negative laws, and can enact new laws, for example the domestic violence or gender-based violence law that was established in Tunisia. This became a success model, because it did not just define gender-based violence as domestic violence inside the home, but rather, as a societal issue, which is really holistic and comprehensive. If women are denied a job because of their gender, it is economic violence; if they face job discrimination, it's economic violence; if they're not able to run for office or to be elected, it\u2019s political violence. So, it took the issue of gender-based violence out of the domestic sphere into a much more public, comprehensive, and holistic sphere.\r\n\r\nSE: The book also discusses the important concept of Arab women\u2019s invisibility. Can you elaborate on this point?\r\n\r\nSK: The book talks about three levels of invisibility that Arab women have been struggling and grappling with. There's invisibility in the academic sphere, where there is not enough literature on Arab women's activism and gendered resistances. Indeed, this book is hoping to fill some of these gaps and help to contribute to this particular area, to bring more attention to this blind spot of underrepresentation in academic literature in terms of women's gendered activisms and resistances. And then you have invisibility in the socio-economic sphere. Women are working long hours, they're not paid to work, and it\u2019s by and large undocumented. These women are viewed as housewives, when in fact, they are contributing tremendously to the economy. Finally, you have invisibility in the media, where images of women do not tend to convey reality. The majority are skewed misrepresentations and stereotypical images. In many cases they are negative images, which show women as repressed or suppressed, as weak, or excluded from decision-making. Additionally, they also become overly sexualized objects, like belly dancers or mistresses without agency. The book tries to defy these three levels of women\u2019s invisibility: academic, socio-economic, and representations in the media.\r\n\r\nSE: I want to ask you about the inclusion of men in feminist discourse. In the Western world, the inclusion of men, or having men as allies of feminist movements in general has become more common. I'm wondering if you've noticed a difference in how that inclusion is taken on, or perceived. How welcome it is within both regions: the West and the Arab region?\r\n\r\nSK: Dr. Brahim El Guabli, who contributed the chapter on Morocco, is Moroccan-American, so he has a foot in each world and acts as a good bridge, not just between genders, but also between different cultures. However, the question is about acceptability: How is society accepting this notion of talking about women's issues and having men who are feminists? Feminism, unfortunately, is still seen as a dirty word. People tend not to understand the term feminism and correlate it with women who are rebellious, unethical, and immoral. I think this misconception is universal, but gets worse in the Arab\/Muslim world. This is something we need to work on as a society, to make people understand that feminism is not a dirty word. Feminism is about women's rights, and women should have a place at the table. If you don't have a place at the table, you will be on the menu. Women have been on the menu for a long time. I think that the idea of having male allies is still not very much the norm because there's still not enough understanding and appreciation of it. This is the case either because of those who think that women's issues should only be addressed and tackled by women, or because the idea of having a male at the table is frowned upon. Men are fathers, they are husbands, they are partners, they are sons, they are brothers, they are colleagues, they are co-workers. If you try to say, \u201cOkay, I'm not going to deal with them, they are the enemy.\u201d How helpful is that going to be?\r\n\r\nSE: What has changed since the book\u2019s publication and what has stayed the same?\r\n\r\nSK: When you talk about the things that were not covered in the book, of course, some things have changed [since publication]. Like I said, Dr. Tsujigami, who wrote about the driving ban in Saudi Arabia, that, of course, has changed with the driving ban being lifted. The guardianship law has also been modified and changed. These moves, however, did not create a shift in societal mindset sufficiently. As I\u2019ve mentioned, laws are very important, but they're not sufficient on their own. How are people looking at women who are driving? Are they welcoming them or not? You cannot erase years of a heavy, rigid, and very traditional interpretation of religion overnight. It's not going to happen. That can take years and years of work, starting from the new generation, in order to change.\r\n\r\nThe #MeToo movement and anti-harassment campaigns really grew and spread after the publication of the book. The book talks about some of the early phases of these efforts, but now, there is more resonance on social media, and there are more campaigns. There is also the very important point about COVID-19, which, of course, happened in 2020 after the book was published. COVID-19 had negative impacts on everyone, but it had an even worse impact on women in particular. Many women lost their jobs, lost their support systems, not to mention the increasing digital divide, which became much worse for women in the Arab world. So, if we were to edit another volume of this book, we would account for all of these new developments, which took place in the Arab region and the world at large, and study their effects and implications on Arab women.\r\n\r\nFor more read Info-Deficiency in an Infodemic: The Gender Digital Gap, Arab Women and the COVID-19 Pandemic, by Dr. Sahar Khamis and Eliza Campbell.\r\n\r\nSahar Khamis\u00a0is an Associate Professor in the Department of Communication and an Affiliate Professor of Women\u2019s Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park.

contemporary conflicts, knowing the enemy—the first lesson in any war—has become elusive. With fewer boots on the ground, less interstate conflict, and more fractured and violent terrorist factions, knowing exactly who one is fighting has become increasingly difficult. Accordingly, information warfare, the control of the narrative, has arguably become the most pressing and challenging issue of our times. It has become imperative for anyone involved in a given conflict to take control of the narrative and communicate their story, ensuring they have the court of public opinion on their side. In other words, in conflict: “The one with the better army may win the battle, but the one with the better story wins the war” (Ebner 2017, 107). Today, history is being written online, narratives and information are communicated through the media, social media platforms, and through all modes of communication on cyberspace, setting the stage for conflict or peace. With the advent of the internet, information has transcended borders and states, and has by and large become controlled by capitalism’s leaders, each with their own agenda. In a recent panel organized by </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Arab Media &amp; Society</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Journal on “Arab Media Between Conflict and Peace” the panelists discussed whether the media promotes or hinders peace and conflict in the region. This article goes over the different ways in which the media has been used to promote conflict, as explored during the panel.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the words of Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, head of the Israel Defense Force’s (IDF) Foreign and Social Media office, as quoted by Professor Emeritus of Journalism and Public Diplomacy at the University of Southern California, Philip Seib, in his book </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Information at War</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">:</span></p><blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are absent on the social media space, you cede that space to the enemy. You have to be there to lead the conversation, especially in war time. If you’re silent on social media, you’re not putting anything in your enemy’s way to prevent their message from gaining steam; if you’re silent on social media, you’re not getting your own message across; and if you’re silent on social media, you’re not giving your supporters ammunition to use. (Seib 2021, Chap. 4) </span></p></blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Information is ammunition and public opinion is, as Seib expressed during the panel, “easily influenced […] with great volatility and susceptibility for manipulation.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">” A</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> great example of this is the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria’s (Daesh) communication strategy. Daesh has established its strength largely by building a media empire that attempts to unite people across the world behind a clear cause and ideology. It also controls its own narrative and story by having its own media outlets and by infiltrating almost all social media platforms, thereby not only communicating its own agenda to the world, but also keeping its followers connected through sensationalism and a sense of community.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The real strength of this network was made evident in 2014, when Daesh took over the city of Mosul in Iraq with minimal resistance. As the world watched the events unfold in Iraq, everyone realized that Mosul was overtaken not with arms, but with tweets. A few months before the invasion, Daesh used “an Arabic-language Twitter app called The Dawn of Glad Tidings, or just Dawn” to purportedly spread its message to its followers (Berger 2014). However, by signing up for the app, users actually gave Daesh access to their twitter accounts. By the time the Daesh army was moving towards Mosul, it had access to hundreds of twitter accounts. It then launched a massive two-fold social media campaign that relied on thousands of tweets and a Hollywood-style movie about the </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">End Times</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> prophecy to spread a message of fear and terror throughout Iraq and the world. According to Julia Ebner, “the sheer number of retweets conveyed the impression of a gigantic, invincible army marching towards Mosul, creating shockwaves across the ranks of the Iraqi army” (Ebner 2017, 105). A pivotal moment, it was then that the magnitude of the strength and impact of hashtags and tweets was made exceptionally evident. Despite outnumbering the Daesh army by over 15 to 1, the Iraqi army was intimidated enough by the impact of Daesh’s social media campaign to flee, “leaving a vacuum for ISIS and other armed forces to fill” (Ebner 2017, 105; Giglio 2014).</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The speed, quality, and magnitude of the campaign were strong enough to manipulate not just regular people at home, but a national army and nation states around the world. Public opinion was sufficiently swayed to engrave terror in people’s hearts. Daesh’s ability to use sensationalism in communicating both terror and a sense of purpose, the former to its enemies, the later to its followers, is indeed unique. However, it has not been the only political faction that has used digital media and the world’s inability to keep up with the speed of the internet in order to build its cause, most do so but in their own way. Seib used the case of the wars between Hamas and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) during the panel to illustrate how digital media can be used to sway public opinion to either extend or end a war. Citing the Gaza Wars of 2008-9 and 2014, Seib explains how the evolution of Hamas’ presence online has affected its fight on the ground. In 2008-9, the disproportionality between the military might of the Israeli army and Hamas was, as is still the case, quite problematic. In order to control the narrative, the Israeli government launched an information campaign that blocked foreign journalists from the combat zone, disseminated its own content on social media on a large scale, and omitted any content that showed any civilian casualties on the Palestinian side. Hamas, on the other hand, only relied on websites and blogs to spread its message (Seib 2021, Chap. 4). By 2014, Hamas had learned the power of tweets and hashtags, and managed to spread its own message using #gazaunderattack in the days leading up to the conflict (Seib 2021, Chap. 4). Hamas’ ability to actively spread its own narrative in 2014 managed to fill the information gap between it and the IDF, which had a significant effect on public opinion around the world. By successfully disseminating their own narrative, they managed to tilt the asymmetry of power a little bit and gain their own edge. According to Seib, Hamas’ capacity to meet the IDF on the information battleground shifted public support towards it and managed, to a certain extent, reduce the intensity of the conflict. </span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That said, the aforementioned shift was not powerful enough to have a major outcome and Israel remains, by all accounts, the more superior force, both on the ground and online. In fact, Israel continuously invests in building its image online and controlling the narrative. In 2014, civilians were also “put to work in assisting [the] war effort” in Israel (Seib 2021, Chap. 4). Launched by over 400 students at an Israeli university, a pro-Israel campaign was put in motion online in over 30-languages. Its goal was to promote the country’s image around the world by spreading a positive narrative and reporting anything against the state of Israel on online platforms. This effort was meant to win the hearts and minds of observers around the world, as David Patrikarakos said “The IDF [had] to meet Hamas not just on the battlefield but in cyberspace. War [has] to be fought at the narrative as well as the physical level” (Seib 2021, Chap. 4). What makes modern warfare unique is that it is no longer strictly fought by soldiers, generals, heads of state, and firearms, it is now also, and one can argue predominantly, fought online through public opinion, citizen journalism, and citizen campaigns. Today, anyone can spread their message and influence political events. While this does not dismiss the importance of military might, it does change the nature of conflict as a whole.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The accessibility of the internet, the idea that anyone can post their opinion, share their reality, or contribute to political discourse has had several effects. It has been an impetus for change in various contexts, whether for small causes, or larger revolutions; and it has also created a climate of distrust, aggression, and radicalization. During the panel Nour Halabi, Lecturer of Media and Communication at the University of Leeds, discussed the effect citizen journalism has had in conveying a different perspective on the war in Syria. She spoke of the humanizing influence citizen journalism has had on the general perception of the conflict around the world, describing it as “a form of resistance” against “the securitized view” projected by mainstream media that is “focused on the different fighting factions and their media arms, [and] often focused on looking at, very much in al Qaeda tradition, new declarations being made by some leader or another” instead of the citizens actually living through the conflict. The internet thus gave filmmakers, citizen journalists, and ordinary Syrians a voice to project their own perspective despite the ongoing conflict, the varying media agendas, and government restrictions. Nonetheless, online activism is far from easy and comes with great risk.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to Professor Sahar Khamis, Associate Professor of Communication, University of Maryland, College Park, cyber-activism carries considerable risk in autocracies and conservative societies, particular for women and feminist activists. The reality of the security risks that individuals who participate in cyber-feminism and online activism is often bleak and dangerous. So, while it can affect change and spread much needed awareness on many important topics, it also comes with its own set of dangers such as tracking, hacking, doxxing (an intimidation tactic where “a person’s personal information—usually address and phone number—[are published] against his or her will”), and harassment (Ebner 2020, 102). These can all be done by regular individuals, organized factions or groups, as well as governments, which further exemplifies the dangers behind the anonymity that the internet offers people, as well as the sheer lack of clear rules or ethics in cyberspace at large. Securitizing information online is its own rabbit hole, as there is no clear way to determine right from wrong, and even fewer ways to  control information without infringing on even the most minimal standards of human rights. The fact that the internet is a global tool makes it quasi-impossible to have common standards in order to establish any overarching internet regulations. </span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As is commonly said, “one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.” Most people believe what they are doing is correct, they believe that they are standing on the right side of history, and therefore their cause or ideology is the more legitimate one. The lack of consensus leaves it up to individual observers to use their own critical thinking in order to determine which narrative is true. Still, corroborating or proving a specific narrative, and thereby building an opinion on any issue has become increasingly difficult in the world of algorithms and echo chambers. ‘Information bubbles’ are common everywhere, particularly on YouTube where the “algorithm fuels radicalisation by prioritising extreme content,” therefore “if you start with a video about jogging, for instance, you can be almost sure to end up seeing extreme Parkour or ultra-marathon videos. And when you watch a vegetarian cooking lessons, you might get suggestions for militant veganism at the end of the day” (Ebner 2020, 114).</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These echo chambers further extend to battle grounds where propaganda is rampant. Panelist Jalel Harchaoui, researcher and analyst of North African affairs, spoke of the complexity of the situation in Libya where disinformation and propaganda are particularly rampant “In Libya it’s particularly spectacular,” expressed Harchaoui.  Describing the extremely polarized conflict in Libya, Harchaoui explained that there has been extensive deterioration in the quality of journalism in the country since the start of the conflict, where trolls have taken over and professionals have been left behind. What makes this situation unique is not the mere existence of a divide, but rather the complexity and extensiveness of its reach as well as the number of foreign actors and third party channels that both fund and support this divide. The sophistication of the methods used to hoax citizens and troll them are extremely high in quality, and as Harchaoui states, can trick even the most seasoned experts. Another facet of this information war is that citizens’ loyalties extend from the battleground to the news sources that they choose to follow or even unfollow. Despite knowing that these sources are likely to be lying, loyalties to specific factions confine them to their channels, making them privy to very limited and extremely subjective news sources. The information circulated on these channels only serve to aggravate the conflict by fostering hate and fear amongst the communities, thereby extending and deepening the civil war. This toxic news environment has exacerbated the situation in Libya to unimaginable levels, furthering the divide and, often, serving agendas of factions and states outside of the country rather than Libyans themselves.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In her work </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Rage: The Vicious Circle of Islamist and Far Right Extremism</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Julia Ebner (2018) argues that:</span></p><blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All that we are fighting for and against are abstract ideas and products of our imagination [...] More than anything else it is a fight for the hearts and minds of the young generations. This fight is in many ways shaped by those who set the agenda for the stories that reach the masses: journalists.</span></p></blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This fight is exponentially harder to win when it is quasi-impossible to find definitive truths in any information we get. The lack of clarity has created an increasingly divisive environment that relies on fearmongering and conspiracy theories. While the media has been a major resource that has made us the most connected era, it has also been thoroughly misused and abused. It has become a double-edged sword that both gives people a sense of purpose and belonging through online communities, and at the same time, an information vacuum that relies on echo-chambers which have become hubs for extremism and radicalism. Our inability to find truth, the increasing divide among societies, the deep-seated need for a cause to believe in, and a ‘right side’ to be on has made us deeply confused and distrustful on one hand, and prone to extremes on the other. Our decreasing attention span, lack of clarity, and the constant bombardment of information have truly made us a ‘lost generation’. So many of us in the Arab world have grown up displaced, as refugees, or at the very least, have witnessed conflict and unrest in our countries. We know firsthand the strength of the media and its ability to unite us, and just as equally if not more, its power to divide us. Therefore, it is up to us now, as educators and the generation that is increasingly in power to promote critical thinking and media literacy. As Professor Seib said during the panel “our rising generations in particular need to be prepared for a civic environment in which information is evermore insignificant.”</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Works Cited:</strong></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Berger, J.

With fewer boots on the ground, less interstate conflict, and more fractured and violent terrorist factions, knowing exactly who one is fighting has become increasingly difficult. Accordingly, information warfare, the control of the narrative, has arguably become the most pressing and challenging issue of our times. It has become imperative for anyone involved in a given conflict to take control of the narrative and communicate their story, ensuring they have the court of public opinion on their side. In other words, in conflict: \u201cThe one with the better army may win the battle, but the one with the better story wins the war\u201d (Ebner 2017, 107). Today, history is being written online, narratives and information are communicated through the media, social media platforms, and through all modes of communication on cyberspace, setting the stage for conflict or peace. With the advent of the internet, information has transcended borders and states, and has by and large become controlled by capitalism\u2019s leaders, each with their own agenda. In a recent panel organized by Arab Media &amp; Society Journal on \u201cArab Media Between Conflict and Peace\u201d the panelists discussed whether the media promotes or hinders peace and conflict in the region. This article goes over the different ways in which the media has been used to promote conflict, as explored during the panel.\r\nIn the words of Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, head of the Israel Defense Force\u2019s (IDF) Foreign and Social Media office, as quoted by Professor Emeritus of Journalism and Public Diplomacy at the University of Southern California, Philip Seib, in his book Information at War:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are absent on the social media space, you cede that space to the enemy. You have to be there to lead the conversation, especially in war time. If you\u2019re silent on social media, you\u2019re not putting anything in your enemy\u2019s way to prevent their message from gaining steam; if you\u2019re silent on social media, you\u2019re not getting your own message across; and if you\u2019re silent on social media, you\u2019re not giving your supporters ammunition to use. (Seib 2021, Chap. 4)\u00a0\r\n\r\nInformation is ammunition and public opinion is, as Seib expressed during the panel, \u201ceasily influenced [\u2026] with great volatility and susceptibility for manipulation.\u201d A great example of this is the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria\u2019s (Daesh) communication strategy. Daesh has established its strength largely by building a media empire that attempts to unite people across the world behind a clear cause and ideology. It also controls its own narrative and story by having its own media outlets and by infiltrating almost all social media platforms, thereby not only communicating its own agenda to the world, but also keeping its followers connected through sensationalism and a sense of community.\r\nThe real strength of this network was made evident in 2014, when Daesh took over the city of Mosul in Iraq with minimal resistance. As the world watched the events unfold in Iraq, everyone realized that Mosul was overtaken not with arms, but with tweets. A few months before the invasion, Daesh used \u201can Arabic-language Twitter app called The Dawn of Glad Tidings, or just Dawn\u201d to purportedly spread its message to its followers (Berger 2014). However, by signing up for the app, users actually gave Daesh access to their twitter accounts. By the time the Daesh army was moving towards Mosul, it had access to hundreds of twitter accounts. It then launched a massive two-fold social media campaign that relied on thousands of tweets and a Hollywood-style movie about the End Times prophecy to spread a message of fear and terror throughout Iraq and the world. According to Julia Ebner, \u201cthe sheer number of retweets conveyed the impression of a gigantic, invincible army marching towards Mosul, creating shockwaves across the ranks of the Iraqi army\u201d (Ebner 2017, 105). A pivotal moment, it was then that the magnitude of the strength and impact of hashtags and tweets was made exceptionally evident. Despite outnumbering the Daesh army by over 15 to 1, the Iraqi army was intimidated enough by the impact of Daesh\u2019s social media campaign to flee, \u201cleaving a vacuum for ISIS and other armed forces to fill\u201d (Ebner 2017, 105; Giglio 2014).\r\nThe speed, quality, and magnitude of the campaign were strong enough to manipulate not just regular people at home, but a national army and nation states around the world. Public opinion was sufficiently swayed to engrave terror in people\u2019s hearts. Daesh\u2019s ability to use sensationalism in communicating both terror and a sense of purpose, the former to its enemies, the later to its followers, is indeed unique. However, it has not been the only political faction that has used digital media and the world\u2019s inability to keep up with the speed of the internet in order to build its cause, most do so but in their own way. Seib used the case of the wars between Hamas and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) during the panel to illustrate how digital media can be used to sway public opinion to either extend or end a war. Citing the Gaza Wars of 2008-9 and 2014, Seib explains how the evolution of Hamas\u2019 presence online has affected its fight on the ground. In 2008-9, the disproportionality between the military might of the Israeli army and Hamas was, as is still the case, quite problematic. In order to control the narrative, the Israeli government launched an information campaign that blocked foreign journalists from the combat zone, disseminated its own content on social media on a large scale, and omitted any content that showed any civilian casualties on the Palestinian side. Hamas, on the other hand, only relied on websites and blogs to spread its message (Seib 2021, Chap. 4). By 2014, Hamas had learned the power of tweets and hashtags, and managed to spread its own message using #gazaunderattack in the days leading up to the conflict (Seib 2021, Chap. 4). Hamas\u2019 ability to actively spread its own narrative in 2014 managed to fill the information gap between it and the IDF, which had a significant effect on public opinion around the world. By successfully disseminating their own narrative, they managed to tilt the asymmetry of power a little bit and gain their own edge. According to Seib, Hamas\u2019 capacity to meet the IDF on the information battleground shifted public support towards it and managed, to a certain extent, reduce the intensity of the conflict.\u00a0\r\nThat said, the aforementioned shift was not powerful enough to have a major outcome and Israel remains, by all accounts, the more superior force, both on the ground and online. In fact, Israel continuously invests in building its image online and controlling the narrative. In 2014, civilians were also \u201cput to work in assisting [the] war effort\u201d in Israel (Seib 2021, Chap. 4). Launched by over 400 students at an Israeli university, a pro-Israel campaign was put in motion online in over 30-languages. Its goal was to promote the country\u2019s image around the world by spreading a positive narrative and reporting anything against the state of Israel on online platforms. This effort was meant to win the hearts and minds of observers around the world, as David Patrikarakos said \u201cThe IDF [had] to meet Hamas not just on the battlefield but in cyberspace. War [has] to be fought at the narrative as well as the physical level\u201d (Seib 2021, Chap. 4). What makes modern warfare unique is that it is no longer strictly fought by soldiers, generals, heads of state, and firearms, it is now also, and one can argue predominantly, fought online through public opinion, citizen journalism, and citizen campaigns. Today, anyone can spread their message and influence political events. While this does not dismiss the importance of military might, it does change the nature of conflict as a whole.\r\nThe accessibility of the internet, the idea that anyone can post their opinion, share their reality, or contribute to political discourse has had several effects. It has been an impetus for change in various contexts, whether for small causes, or larger revolutions; and it has also created a climate of distrust, aggression, and radicalization. During the panel Nour Halabi, Lecturer of Media and Communication at the University of Leeds, discussed the effect citizen journalism has had in conveying a different perspective on the war in Syria. She spoke of the humanizing influence citizen journalism has had on the general perception of the conflict around the world, describing it as \u201ca form of resistance\u201d against \u201cthe securitized view\u201d projected by mainstream media that is \u201cfocused on the different fighting factions and their media arms, [and] often focused on looking at, very much in al Qaeda tradition, new declarations being made by some leader or another\u201d instead of the citizens actually living through the conflict. The internet thus gave filmmakers, citizen journalists, and ordinary Syrians a voice to project their own perspective despite the ongoing conflict, the varying media agendas, and government restrictions. Nonetheless, online activism is far from easy and comes with great risk.\r\nAccording to Professor Sahar Khamis, Associate Professor of Communication, University of Maryland, College Park, cyber-activism carries considerable risk in autocracies and conservative societies, particular for women and feminist activists. The reality of the security risks that individuals who participate in cyber-feminism and online activism is often bleak and dangerous. So, while it can affect change and spread much needed awareness on many important topics, it also comes with its own set of dangers such as tracking, hacking, doxxing (an intimidation tactic where \u201ca person\u2019s personal information\u2014usually address and phone number\u2014[are published] against his or her will\u201d), and harassment (Ebner 2020, 102). These can all be done by regular individuals, organized factions or groups, as well as governments, which further exemplifies the dangers behind the anonymity that the internet offers people, as well as the sheer lack of clear rules or ethics in cyberspace at large. Securitizing information online is its own rabbit hole, as there is no clear way to determine right from wrong, and even fewer ways to\u00a0 control information without infringing on even the most minimal standards of human rights. The fact that the internet is a global tool makes it quasi-impossible to have common standards in order to establish any overarching internet regulations.\u00a0\r\nAs is commonly said, \u201cone man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.\u201d Most people believe what they are doing is correct, they believe that they are standing on the right side of history, and therefore their cause or ideology is the more legitimate one. The lack of consensus leaves it up to individual observers to use their own critical thinking in order to determine which narrative is true. Still, corroborating or proving a specific narrative, and thereby building an opinion on any issue has become increasingly difficult in the world of algorithms and echo chambers. \u2018Information bubbles\u2019 are common everywhere, particularly on YouTube where the \u201calgorithm fuels radicalisation by prioritising extreme content,\u201d therefore \u201cif you start with a video about jogging, for instance, you can be almost sure to end up seeing extreme Parkour or ultra-marathon videos. And when you watch a vegetarian cooking lessons, you might get suggestions for militant veganism at the end of the day\u201d (Ebner 2020, 114).\r\nThese echo chambers further extend to battle grounds where propaganda is rampant. Panelist Jalel Harchaoui, researcher and analyst of North African affairs, spoke of the complexity of the situation in Libya where disinformation and propaganda are particularly rampant \u201cIn Libya it\u2019s particularly spectacular,\u201d expressed Harchaoui.\u00a0 Describing the extremely polarized conflict in Libya, Harchaoui explained that there has been extensive deterioration in the quality of journalism in the country since the start of the conflict, where trolls have taken over and professionals have been left behind. What makes this situation unique is not the mere existence of a divide, but rather the complexity and extensiveness of its reach as well as the number of foreign actors and third party channels that both fund and support this divide. The sophistication of the methods used to hoax citizens and troll them are extremely high in quality, and as Harchaoui states, can trick even the most seasoned experts. Another facet of this information war is that citizens\u2019 loyalties extend from the battleground to the news sources that they choose to follow or even unfollow. Despite knowing that these sources are likely to be lying, loyalties to specific factions confine them to their channels, making them privy to very limited and extremely subjective news sources. The information circulated on these channels only serve to aggravate the conflict by fostering hate and fear amongst the communities, thereby extending and deepening the civil war. This toxic news environment has exacerbated the situation in Libya to unimaginable levels, furthering the divide and, often, serving agendas of factions and states outside of the country rather than Libyans themselves.\r\nIn her work The Rage: The Vicious Circle of Islamist and Far Right Extremism, Julia Ebner (2018) argues that:\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that we are fighting for and against are abstract ideas and products of our imagination [...] More than anything else it is a fight for the hearts and minds of the young generations. This fight is in many ways shaped by those who set the agenda for the stories that reach the masses: journalists.\r\n\r\nThis fight is exponentially harder to win when it is quasi-impossible to find definitive truths in any information we get. The lack of clarity has created an increasingly divisive environment that relies on fearmongering and conspiracy theories. While the media has been a major resource that has made us the most connected era, it has also been thoroughly misused and abused. It has become a double-edged sword that both gives people a sense of purpose and belonging through online communities, and at the same time, an information vacuum that relies on echo-chambers which have become hubs for extremism and radicalism. Our inability to find truth, the increasing divide among societies, the deep-seated need for a cause to believe in, and a \u2018right side\u2019 to be on has made us deeply confused and distrustful on one hand, and prone to extremes on the other. Our decreasing attention span, lack of clarity, and the constant bombardment of information have truly made us a \u2018lost generation\u2019. So many of us in the Arab world have grown up displaced, as refugees, or at the very least, have witnessed conflict and unrest in our countries. We know firsthand the strength of the media and its ability to unite us, and just as equally if not more, its power to divide us. Therefore, it is up to us now, as educators and the generation that is increasingly in power to promote critical thinking and media literacy. As Professor Seib said during the panel \u201cour rising generations in particular need to be prepared for a civic environment in which information is evermore insignificant.\u201d\r\nWorks Cited:\r\nBerger, J.

It examines Egyptian feelings of collective insecurity and the role of group-based affect and group identity when exposed to a mediated out-group threat. Specifically, the study utilized the Ethiopians’ Al-Nahda Dam as an economic, safety, and cultural example of out-group threat to disentangle the effects of distinct types of threats and media outlets on the cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses of Egyptian audiences. Using a sample of 613 Egyptian respondents, recruited through an online survey service, this study explored the circumstances under which Egyptians might experience direct fear and anxiety when exposed to threatening news coverage of Al-Nahda Dam. Results from this study provide support for the proposed hypotheses related to the mediated role of distinct affective reactions to threat, exposure to different issues communicated by the media about the Ethiopian dam. Given these results, recommendations for future research are discussed, with particular emphasis on the role of political ideology and media content. It also expands the research on the potential for media to evoke this out-group directed affective response. Future scholarship could also examine the role of group identities and salient group membership in creating feelings of collective insecurity.  </span></p><div class=""page"" title=""Page 1""><div class=""layoutArea""><h3 style=""direction: rtl; text-align: justify;""><strong>التغطية الإخبارية لأزمة ""سد النهضة"" وتشكيل الإحساس بالتهديد الجمعي </strong><strong>لدى أفراد الجمهور المصري: دراسة مسحية</strong></h3><p style=""direction: rtl; text-align: justify;"">استهدفت الدراسة الحالية توسيع نطاق الدراسات ذات الصلة بشعور الأفراد بالخطر والتهديد عبر فحص دور التأثير المستند إلى محتوى وسائل الإعلام، وهوية المجموعة Identification &amp; self-categorization، فضلًا عن تأثير كل من خريطة تحيز الأفراد فكريًا أو شعوريًا على الجماعات المختلفة Bias Map، ومفاهيم الهيمنة الاجتماعية Social Dominance، والنفور الاجتماعي  Social Aversion...الخ، في علاقتها بشعور الأفراد بالتهديد؛ وذلك بغرض فصل تأثير مجموعة المتغيرات، النفسية والمجتمعية، ذات الصلة بشعور الأفراد بالتهديد الجمعي، بما فيها وسائل الإعلام، عن بعضها البعض من جهة، فضلًا عن اختبار تأثيرها في سلوك الأفراد نحو الجماعات الخارجية المختلفة في نهاية المطاف، من جهة أخرى. وتعتمد الدراسة على توظيف نظرية ""التهديد بين الجماعات"" Group Threat Theory (Stephan and Stephan 2000) إطارا نظريا، وهو ما أمكن ترجمته إلى مجموعة من الفروض والتساؤلات البحثية العامة، أهمها: متى ينساق الأفراد لما تقدمه وسائل الإعلام من تهديد يرتبط بجماعة بعينها خارج المجتمع، ومتى يقاومون هذه الرسائل المُحفزة ضد هذه الجماعة؟! وما المتغيرات الاجتماعية والنفسية المؤثرة التي تتوسط العلاقة في كلتا الحالتين؟!</p><p style=""direction: rtl; text-align: justify;"">أثبتت نتائج الدراسة أنه على الرغم مما أثبته الكثير من الأدبيات السابقة بشأن تحقق العلاقة المباشرة بين الشعور بالتهديد الجمعي (الاقتصادي/الأخلاقي/الجسدي...) الذي تشكله جماعة خارجية ما كما تعرض له التغطية الإعلامية، وكل من العلاقات المتوترة والمُهدِدة بين المجموعات من جهة، والاستجابات العاطفية للجمهور (الغضب/الخوف/الإشمئزاز...) من جهة أخرى، فإن هذا يأتي - في الوقت نفسه - الذي توصلت فيه مجموعة أخرى من هذه الدراسات إلى أن ثبوت هذه العلاقات يعتمد على طبيعة التهديد ذاته بالأساس.</p></div></div></div><div class=""clear""></div></div> <script type=""application/ld+json"">{""@context"":""http:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""NewsArticle"",""dateCreated"":""2022-02-27T09:45:18+00:00"",""datePublished"":""2022-02-27T09:45:18+00:00"",""dateModified"":""2022-03-03T15:13:04+00:00"",""headline"":""The Impact of Threatening News Coverage of the Ethiopian \u201cAl-Nahda Dam\u201d on Egyptian Collective Insecurity (Arabic)"",""name"":""The Impact of Threatening News Coverage of the Ethiopian \u201cAl-Nahda Dam\u201d on Egyptian Collective Insecurity (Arabic)"",""keywords"":""Al-Nahda Dam,Collective Insecurity,Crises,Group Threat Theory,News Coverage"",""url"":""https:\/\/www.arabmediasociety.com\/the-impact-of-threatening-news-coverage-of-the-ethiopian-al-nahda-dam-on-egyptian-collective-insecurity-arabic\/"",""description"":""Scroll down for Arabic abstract.

justify;"">This article examines the processes by which Jewish Americans become involved in Palestine solidarity activism through a case study of the non-profit organization, Jewish Voice for Peace. This study finds American Jews tend to attribute their support for Palestine to historical events and media rather than planned activities such as interfaith dialogue and awareness-raising initiatives. In addition, despite popular perceptions that understand Jewish Americans’ paths to supporting Palestinians as uniquely arduous, my data suggest that most Jewish activists in the Palestine solidarity movement did not go through major ideological transformations to arrive at their positions. Instead, support for Palestine appears to be more ideologically accessible to Jewish activists than previously theorized. These findings suggest that media can serve as a powerful force to reorganize diasporic commitments and generate transnational support for justice and peace in the Arab world. They also imply that Western support for anticolonial struggles in the Middle East is more likely to be won through accurately reporting on such events rather than more targeted interventions designed to change people’s minds. While many social change organizations devote considerable resources to shifting the thinking of people who oppose their cause, my data suggest that such resources may be better spent mobilizing these groups’ existing bases.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Introduction</strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In Jewish community centers, schools, and synagogues throughout the United States, American Jews are socialized to identify as members of a diaspora that centers Israel as the Jewish homeland. This process is undergirded by economic and political forces that incentivize American Jews to support the state of Israel which in turn, often lead Jewish Americans to side with Israel in its conflict with the Palestinians. The 2020 Pew study of Jewish Americans, for example, found that 82 percent of Jews consider caring about Israel to be either an important or essential part of their Jewish identity, and the majority of American Jews reported feeling very or at least somewhat attached to Israel (Pew Research Center). Furthermore, while only two percent of American Jews strongly support the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions (BDS) movement (a clear indicator of political solidarity with Palestinians), 34 percent strongly oppose it.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Despite this context, a growing contingent of American Jews are mobilizing in support of Palestinians’ rights and against the state of Israel. One of the organizations at the center of this activism is Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP). According to their mission statement:</p><blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">JVP seeks an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem; security and self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians; a just solution for Palestinian refugees based on principles established in international law; an end to violence against civilians; and peace and justice for all peoples of the Middle East (Jewish Voice for Peace).</p></blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">JVP has over 70 local chapters and more than 200,000 supporters. In addition, the organization includes a Rabbinic Council, an Artist Council, an Academic Advisory Council, a youth wing, as well as an advisory board comprised of high-profile public figures. In recent years, JVP has experienced significant growth, with their $400,000 budget in 2009 rising to nearly $3 million in 2021 (Jewish Voice for Peace).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This study analyzes data from a survey of JVP’s national members in order to understand the factors that lead American Jews to support the Palestinian cause. The results of the survey (n=690) show that a majority of JVP members experienced a turning point in their political views on Israel/Palestine. Surprisingly, the results also reveal that Jewish members of JVP experienced ideological turning points at roughly the same rate as non-Jewish members. The data further suggest that most JVP members, both Jewish and non-Jewish, overwhelmingly attributed the cause of their turning points to historical events and the media’s portrayal of those events. These findings speak to the power of media in shaping transnational political action through facilitating ideological transformations among diaspora groups. They also challenge the idea that Jewish identity hinders individuals’ involvement in Palestine solidarity activism. Contrary to past research and popular perceptions, the process of ideological transformation on Israel/Palestine appears to be quite similar for both Jewish and non-Jewish activists in the Palestine solidarity movement.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Diaspora and Zionism</strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In many ways, Jews are the quintessential diaspora group, with the term often used to directly describe the Jewish people’s millennia-old history of exile and transnational community (Ages 1973). More generally, diaspora refers to any group that is scattered throughout the world from their historical homeland and still maintains a common bond of ethnicity, religion, culture, and/or national identity (Coles and Timothy 2004). Current conceptions of Jewish diaspora that locate this historical homeland within the state of Israel are rooted in the rise of the Zionist movement (Smith 1988). Although early Zionists entertained several locations for the Jewish state, Zionism today generally refers to a Jewish state in Israel/Palestine (Spangler 2015). As such, Zionism is often conceptualized as the return of the Jewish people to their ancient, biblical homeland<em>, Eretz Yisrael</em>. As the Israeli National Anthem goes:</p><blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As long as within our hearts The Jewish soul sings,<br/> As long as forward to the East To Zion, looks the eye –</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our hope is not yet lost,<br/> It is two thousand years old,<br/> To be a free people in our land The land of Zion and Jerusalem.</p></blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nearly half of American Jews have traveled to Israel, with those under 35 often first traveling there on an organized homeland tour called Birthright. Founded in 1999, Birthright has brought over 750,000 young people with Jewish lineage on free ten-day tours to Israel (Birthright Israel). The program, which targets 18 to 26-year-olds, has become a cornerstone of the Jewish-American experience, and a rite of passage for many Jewish-American millennials (Saxe and Chazan 2008). On these trips, young American Jews are further socialized into supporting the state of Israel through touristic activities that emphasize the Jewish people’s ancient, diasporic connection to the land of Israel.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In contrast to such mainstream approaches to Jewish nationhood, scholars such as Boyarin and Boyarin (2003) have argued for the revival of diaspora, not Zionism, as the central, organizing tenet of Jewish identity. According to Boyarin and Boyarin, Jewish identity should move away from a focus on geography, and instead celebrate the de-territorialized, generational connections among Jews that have functioned to preserve ancient beliefs and traditions. Instead of striving for a “proud resting place,” they suggest that Jewish identity should be defined by a permanent state of dispersal, composed of “perpetual, creative, diasporic, tension” (Boyarin and Boyarin 2003, 103). Stuart Hall (1994) similarly rejects the centrality of collective, physical return in his conception of diaspora. Like Boyarin and Boyarin, Hall prioritizes the <em>experience</em> of diaspora rather than the elimination of diasporic exile. As he explains:</p><blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">[D]iaspora does not refer us to those scattered tribes whose identity can only be secured in relation to some sacred homeland to which they must at all costs return, even if it means pushing other people into the sea… this is the old, the imperialising, the hegemonising, form of 'ethnicity'. We have seen the fate of the people of Palestine at the hands of this backward-looking conception of diaspora - and the complicity of the West with it. (Hall 1994, 235).</p></blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this quote, Hall directly refers to the ongoing displacement and oppression of the Palestinian people that has resulted from the Zionist movement. While Zionism is often presented as a movement for self-determination of the Jewish people, it is also settler-colonial force, as Palestine was inhabited by over half a million Palestinians, most of whom were forcibly expelled, at the time of Zionist settlement (Halper 2021; Khalidi 1991; Mamdani 2020; Pappé 2007; Sekaily 2015).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a result of Israeli settler colonialism, Palestinians have now lived under a direct military occupation for over half a century. Numerous international agencies and local organizations have documented the plethora of human rights abuses that occur on a daily basis in the Occupied Territories. For example, despite Israeli citizens’ ability to move freely between Israel-proper and the West Bank, Palestinians’ movement is blocked by hundreds of Israeli checkpoints, road blocks, and closures. These obstructions to Palestinian movement not only cause humiliation and violence, but they also produce economic stagnation, serve as a mechanism for land confiscation, and facilitate Israeli control and surveillance (Gordon 2008; Halper 2021; Khalili 2012). Despite this extreme imbalance of power and the disproportionate number of Palestinian casualties from the conflict, 58 percent of Americans report that they sympathize with Israelis, while only 25 percent more strongly sympathize with Palestinians (Saad 2021). As previously discussed, support for Israel is even more pronounced among American Jews. Rather than simply being a matter of politics, allegiance to Israel is deeply woven into many Jewish Americans’ senses of identity and connections to Judaism (Waxman 2016).</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Dissent in the Diaspora</strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">While most American Jews hold favorable views towards Israel, a growing number of American Jews are resisting their communities’ support for Israel and are mobilizing in solidarity with Palestinians. This shift has a generational character, as younger American Jews are diverging from previous generations’ seemingly unequivocal support for Israel (Cohen and Kelman 2010; Sasson 2010; Waxman 2017). According to the Pew study:</p><blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Young U.S. Jews are less emotionally attached to Israel than older ones. As of 2020, half of Jewish adults under age 30 describe themselves as very or somewhat emotionally attached to Israel (48%), compared with two-thirds of Jews ages 65 and older (Pew Research Center).</p></blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Several scholars attribute this shift to the “distancing hypothesis,” which asserts that young Jews are less attached to Israel than previous generations (Cohen and Kelman 2010). Other scholars, however, maintain that young Jews’ more critical stances represent a deeper engagement with Israel, rather than alienation from it (Sasson et al. 2010; Waxman 2017). Regardless as to which interpretation more accurately describes this trend, Jewish communities across the United States are nonetheless being forced to grapple with growing internal resistance to Zionism.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the clearest manifestations of this trend is the recent proliferation of nonprofit organizations that aim to mobilize the Jewish-American population into a more critical relationship towards the Israeli state. In 2007, J Street, the first liberal “pro-Israel, pro-peace” lobby of its size entered the political scene. J Street’s mission statement reads, “J Street organizes pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans to promote US policies that embody our deeply held Jewish and democratic values and that help secure the State of Israel as a democratic homeland for the Jewish people.” (J Street). J Street is adamant about being characterized as a pro-Israel organization, and clearly affirms its belief in the Zionist ideal of a Jewish homeland. Despite this, J Street’s inclusion in “pro-Israel” spaces continues to be a point of controversy, which has resulted in repeated instances of J Street being ousted from Jewish federations, synagogues, and campus groups (e.g., Elsner 2018; Grubaugh 2013; Sokol and Shwayder 2014).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Five years after J Street was founded, Open Hillel, a student-led initiative, was formed after Harvard’s Progressive Jewish Alliance (PJA) was barred from co-hosting a panel with the Palestine Solidarity Committee entitled “Jewish Voices Against the Occupation.” To justify its stance, Hillel (the Foundation for Jewish Campus Life) cited its guidelines of not allowing chapters to partner with, house, or host organizations, groups, or speakers who:</p><ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li>Deny the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish and democratic state with secure and recognized borders</li><li>Delegitimize, demonize, or apply a double standard to Israel</li><li>Support boycott of, divestment from, or sanctions against the State of Israel</li><li>Exhibit a pattern of disruptive behavior towards campus events or guest speakers or foster an atmosphere of incivility (Hillel, n.d.).</li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;"">On account of such restrictions, the Open Hillel movement accused Hillel International of creating a litmus test for inclusion in Jewish campus communities based on students’ support for Israel. Students from across the country identified with the group’s critiques, and joined the movement to begin pushing for more inclusive Hillel guidelines while resisting Hillel’s attempts to silence critics of Israel (Open Hillel, n.d.).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Though formed in 1996, Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) has experienced massive growth in recent years, with some calling it the fastest growing Jewish organization in the United States (Halper 2021). As JVP continues to increase its membership, its politics have moved steadily to the left. In 2011, JVP members voted to officially endorse Palestinian civil society’s call to support the BDS movement, and in 2018, JVP issued a statement announcing its official opposition to Zionism. JVP’s political stances position them outside the margins of most mainstream Jewish-American approaches to Israel/Palestine, and within the realm of Palestinian solidarity activism. Still, in spite of their relative distance from mainstream Jewish institutional thought, JVP continues to grow as a prominent force for U.S.-based Jewish solidarity with the Palestinian people.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a political “middle-ground” between J Street and Jewish Voice for Peace, If Not Now was founded in 2014 in response to that year’s major Israeli assault on Gaza. Today, If Not Now serves as an activist home for many young Jewish Americans who oppose Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. While J Street focuses more heavily on institutional channels of change at the government level, and JVP embraces traditional solidarity politics, If Not Now focuses specifically on shifting the political climate within the Jewish American community through education, direct action, and targeted political campaigns. Unlike J Street and JVP, If Not Now directs their activism exclusively towards Jewish-American support for the occupation. For example, If Not Now launched their #YouNeverToldMe campaign to encourage young Jews to share personal stories of problematic Israel education programs as well as their #NotJustAFreeTrip campaign, which focused on critiquing Birthright.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Methods and Case Study: Jewish Voice for Peace</strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This analysis focuses specifically on Jewish Voice for Peace as a case study to understand how diaspora Jews become involved in Palestine solidarity activism. Since JVP’s members represent some of the most engaged and steadfast Jewish critics of Israel, their paths to activism provide a useful lens into the processes that facilitate engagement with the Palestinian cause among American Jews. Given the ways that many American Jews are socialized to understand themselves as members of a diaspora that should support the Israeli state, this study uses the case of JVP to identify which factors may motivate Jewish Americans to reformulate their relationships to Israel/Palestine. Specifically, I collaborated with staff members at JVP to include a series of questions on their 2015 membership survey that was then used to analyze their members’ political views and ideological transformations on Israel/Palestine.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Jewish members of JVP vary in terms of their relationships to Judaism and how they understand the concept of a Jewish diaspora. In 2017, JVP’s New York chapter published a book entitled, <em>Confronting Zionism: A Collection of Personal Stories</em> (Jewish Voice for Peace NYC 2017). In these stories, JVP members detail the ways that they were raised to see themselves as members of a Jewish diaspora that centered Israel as their homeland. For example, as Talia Baurer writes, “I grew up knowing that Israel was my homeland, that I had deep biblical and historical roots there, and that its existence made me safer in the world – among other insidious mythologies.” In 2019, JVP launched a monthly podcast entitled <em>Diaspora</em>. In the series, various JVP members share accounts of how they were taught to associate their Jewish identity with Israel and to embrace traditional conceptions of Zionism. While there are certainly some members of JVP whose relationships to Judaism and diaspora are less pronounced, these cultural products highlight the large number of JVP members who identify as diaspora Jews.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Based on anecdotal accounts such as those detailed above as well as national polls that demonstrate overwhelming support for Israel within the Jewish community, one would suspect that Jewish activists would experience more arduous paths to supporting the Palestinian cause than non-Jewish Palestine solidarity activists. In order to explore this hypothesis, a series of questions were developed and included on the JVP national membership survey. The first of these questions asked JVP members, “Before becoming a JVP supporter, your political views on Israel/Palestine were:”</p><ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li>The same as they are today more or less.</li><li>Slightly less critical of Israel.</li><li>Much more supportive of Israel.</li><li>More critical of Israel<sup> (<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2""><span>[1]</span></a>)</sup>.</li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Respondents who answered “slightly less critical of Israel” and “much more supportive of Israel” were combined to form a single variable of “less critical of Israel before joining the organization.” This created a dichotomous variable to compare those who were previously less critical of Israel to those who had similar views of Israel before joining JVP. Next, respondents were asked, “Was there ever a turning point(s) in your activism or views on Israel/Palestine?” - Yes or No. If respondents answered “Yes,” they were then asked, “What caused the shift in your views/opinions about Palestine/Israel?”</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The survey was sent via email to all of JVP’s members (about 6,000 individuals). The survey had around an 11 percent response rate, with 680 people completing the online questionnaire. Of these 680 responses, 501 individuals, who met the criteria for analysis<sup>(<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3""><span>[2]</span></a>)</sup>, responded to the question regarding their views on Israel before joining JVP and 487 responded to the turning point question. Of the 332 respondents who answered “yes” to having experienced a turning point, 276 responded to the follow-up question – “What caused the shift in your views/opinions about Israel/Palestine?” The options for this question included:</p><ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li>Exposure to different media/news outlets</li><li>Seeing/participating in an [organization] or other group’s protest online or in-person</li><li>Attending a local [organization] or other group’s educational event</li><li>Experiencing a particular cultural work – book, film, play, dance, article, etc.</li><li>A specific historical event (war, intifada, etc.)</li><li>An academic experience – class, lecture, etc.</li><li>Meeting/speaking with Palestinians</li><li>An interfaith/dialogue/educational program</li><li>Traveling to or living in Israel/Palestine</li><li>Other (fill in the blank)</li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Many respondents selected more than one option due to the ‘select all that apply’ nature of the question. About half of the respondents to the survey identified as Jewish, while the other half did not. To compare the responses of these two groups, multivariate logistic regression and t-tests were conducted to analyze the results of the survey.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Findings</strong></h4><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><em>Similarities Between Jews and Non-Jews’ Previous Views</em></strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As seen below in Table 1 and Figure 1, Jewish and non-Jewish JVP members’ answers to the question of “Before becoming a JVP supporter, your political views on Israel/Palestine were:” followed similar patterns. About 75 percent of Jewish JVP members had the same level of critique of Israel before joining JVP, whereas about 25 percent were less critical of Israel before joining JVP. Non-Jewish JVP members had an almost identical breakdown, also with about 75 percent having the same level of critique before joining JVP and about 25 percent being less critical before joining the organization.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Table 1: Respondents’ Level of Critique of Israel Before Joining the Organization</em></p><table class=""aligncenter""><tbody><tr><td width=""221""></td><td width=""106"">% (n)</td></tr><tr><td width=""221""><em>Total (n=501)</em></td><td width=""106""></td></tr><tr><td width=""221"">   Same Level of Critique</td><td width=""106"">75.05 (376)</td></tr><tr><td width=""221"">   Less Critical Before</td><td width=""106"">24.95 (125)</td></tr><tr><td width=""221""><em>Jewish (n=250)</em></td><td width=""106""></td></tr><tr><td width=""221"">   Same Level of Critique</td><td width=""106"">75.20 (188)</td></tr><tr><td width=""221"">   Less Critical Before</td><td width=""106"">24.80 (62)</td></tr><tr><td width=""221""><em>Not Jewish (n=251)</em></td><td width=""106""></td></tr><tr><td width=""221"">   Same Level of Critique</td><td width=""106"">74.90 (188)</td></tr><tr><td width=""221""><strong>    </strong>Less Critical Before</td><td width=""106"">25.10 (63)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-7802 aligncenter"" data-lazy-sizes=""(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px"" data-lazy-src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-300x219.png"" data-lazy-srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-300x219.png 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1.png 754w"" height=""334"" src=""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20458%20334'%3E%3C/svg%3E"" width=""458""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-7802 aligncenter"" height=""334"" sizes=""(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px"" src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-300x219.png"" srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-300x219.png 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1.png 754w"" width=""458""/></noscript></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Figure 1. Views on Israel Before Joining the Organization</em></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Given the ways that American Jews are socialized to support the state of Israel, one would expect that Jewish respondents would have been less critical of Israel prior to joining JVP compared to non-Jewish members. While support for Israel is common across the entire American population, Jewish Americans consistently express higher rates of support for Israel than the general population, and this support is often interwoven into individuals’ sense of a diasporic identity. In a poll administered by the Ruderman Family Foundation of 2,500 American Jews, about two-thirds of respondents reported that they are emotionally “attached” or “very attached” to Israel, and four out of five respondents identified as “pro-Israel” (Winter 2020). As such, one would expect that a significantly larger proportion of Jewish JVP members would have previously been less critical of Israel prior to joining JVP compared to non-Jewish members. Instead, the data showed a similar division between those who were previously less critical of Israel and those who had the same level of critique before joining the organization for Jews and non-Jews.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is also surprising that a large proportion of JVP members (both Jewish and non-Jewish) had relatively similar views on Israel/Palestine before joining JVP compared to their political views today. According to a 2018 Gallup poll (see Figure 2), 65 percent of U.S citizens answered “Israelis” to the question of “In the Middle East, are your sympathies more with Israelis or more with Palestinians?” In contrast, only 19 percent of people answered “Palestinians.” These statistics would suggest that most Americans would need to experience a significant shift in their political thinking to support an organization like JVP, since people in the United States are more likely to be conditioned to support Israelis over Palestinians. In other words, because dominant political frameworks on Israel/Palestine in the United States tend to facilitate widespread support for Israelis over Palestinians, one might assume that someone who came to support an organization like JVP would have previously been less critical of Israel.</p><p><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-7803 aligncenter"" data-lazy-sizes=""(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px"" data-lazy-src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1-300x130.png"" data-lazy-srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1-300x130.png 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1-1024x442.png 1024w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1-768x332.png 768w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1-1536x664.png 1536w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1.png 1782w"" height=""244"" src=""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20563%20244'%3E%3C/svg%3E"" width=""563""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-7803 aligncenter"" height=""244"" sizes=""(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px"" src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1-300x130.png"" srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1-300x130.png 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1-1024x442.png 1024w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1-768x332.png 768w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1-1536x664.png 1536w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-1.png 1782w"" width=""563""/></noscript></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Figure 2: 2018 Gallup Poll “In the Middle East, are your sympathies more with Israelis or more with Palestinians?</em></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This finding is especially surprising for Jewish JVP members. According to the aforementioned 2020 Pew Study, 82 percent of Jews consider caring about Israel to be either an important or essential part of their Jewish identity (Pew Research Center). An even clearer indication of Jewish Americans’ support for Israel is seen in the 2018 Jewish Electorate’s Survey, which showed that 92 percent of Jewish voters consider themselves to be some variant of “pro-Israel” (Morganti 2020). Given these statistics, it is particularly noteworthy that so many Jewish members were already critical of Israel before joining JVP.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">These findings were corroborated by respondents’ answers to the question of whether they experienced a turning point in their views on Israel/Palestine (see Table 2 and Figure 3). Again, one would expect that Jewish respondents would go through turning points at a higher rate than the non-Jewish participants, since most American Jews politically identify with Israel and would therefore need to experience a significant ideological transformation to become Palestine solidarity activists. In contrast, however, both Jewish and non-Jewish JVP members expressed relatively similar rates of experiencing a turning point in their views on Israel/Palestine. While 69 percent of Jews experienced a turning point, 67 percent of non-Jews experienced one as well. Although Jews experienced a turning point at a slightly higher rate than non-Jews, this difference was not statistically significant and therefore does not appear to represent a meaningful difference.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Table 2: Rates of Turning Points</em></p><table class=""aligncenter""><tbody><tr><td width=""0""></td><td width=""0"">% (n)</td></tr><tr><td width=""192""><em>Total (n=487)</em></td><td width=""106""></td></tr><tr><td width=""192""><strong>   </strong>Turning Point</td><td width=""106"">68.17 (332)</td></tr><tr><td width=""192""><strong>   </strong>No Turning Point</td><td width=""106"">31.83 (155)</td></tr><tr><td width=""192""><em>Jewish (n=242)</em></td><td width=""106""></td></tr><tr><td width=""192"">   Turning Point</td><td width=""106"">69.42 (168)</td></tr><tr><td width=""192"">   No Turning Point</td><td width=""106"">30.58 (74)</td></tr><tr><td width=""192""><em>Not Jewish (n=245)</em></td><td width=""106""></td></tr><tr><td width=""192""><strong>   </strong>Turning Point</td><td width=""106"">66.94 (164)</td></tr><tr><td width=""192""><strong>   </strong>No Turning Point</td><td width=""106"">33.06 (81)</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" class=""alignnone wp-image-7804"" data-lazy-sizes=""(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px"" data-lazy-src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-2-300x219.png"" data-lazy-srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-2-300x219.png 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-2-768x560.png 768w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-2.png 947w"" height=""293"" src=""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20401%20293'%3E%3C/svg%3E"" width=""401""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""alignnone wp-image-7804"" height=""293"" sizes=""(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px"" src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-2-300x219.png"" srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-2-300x219.png 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-2-768x560.png 768w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-2.png 947w"" width=""401""/></noscript></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Figure 3. Turning Points Among Jewish Versus Non-Jewish JVP Members</em></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Analyzed together with the previous results on criticism of Israel before joining JVP, these findings suggest that contrary to what the existing literature on Jewish Americans’ relationships to Israel would imply, Jews who join organizations that are highly critical of Israel do not appear to have gone through transformative processes at higher rates than the non-Jewish members of those organizations. In other words, diaspora Jews involved in Palestine solidarity organizations do not change their political views on Israel/Palestine before becoming activists at significantly higher rates than the non-Jewish members of those organizations. While these data cannot speak to whether those transformations were perhaps more intense for Jewish respondents – they do reveal a surprising result, that Jewish and non-Jewish activists go through a turning point in their views on Israel/Palestine at similar rates.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Turning Points and Media</strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In contrast to the first finding that seemed to suggest that most respondents did not go through a significant political transformation regarding their views on Israel/Palestine, most respondents (both Jewish and non-Jewish) answered “yes” to the question of “was there ever a turning point(s) in your activism or views on Israel/Palestine?” As previously discussed, national polls suggest that around 65 percent of Americans express support for Israelis over Palestinians. This aligns with the survey data that shows that around 67 percent of non-Jewish JVP members experienced a turning point around their views on Israel/Palestine. In theory, if JVP members reflect wider attitudinal trends in U.S society, one would expect for about two-thirds of its members to experience a shift in thinking, which is what the data showed.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">These findings suggest that there is not a significant difference in terms of the prevalence of ideological turning points between Jewish and non-Jewish Palestine solidarity activists. Jewish activists only experience turning points at a slightly higher rate than non-Jewish activists, and this difference was not statistically significant. These findings therefore challenge recent academic scholarship that centers overcoming Zionism in diaspora Jews’ support for Palestinians (Omer 2019; Schneider 2019; Waxman 2016). In addition, these findings suggest that it is quite common for both Jewish and non-Jewish pro-Palestinian activists to experience a turning point in their views on Israel/Palestine. This result then begs the question of which factors are most likely to facilitate such turning points.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As seen in Table 3 and Figure 4, the most common reasons that respondents attributed to their shift in views on Israel/Palestine were historical events<sup>(<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4""><span>[3]</span></a>)</sup> and media. Given the fact that historical/current events are often learned about through various types of media, it appears that most activists changed their positions on Israel/Palestine because of media coverage of the conflict. Even more so than non-Jews, Jewish activists overwhelmingly attributed their turning points on Israel/Palestine to historical events and the media. Accordingly, these findings speak to the power of media in shaping transnational political allegiances among diaspora groups, in that media coverage of current events may have the ability to reorganize diaspora groups’ political relationships to a base state and to make them more critical of a “homeland” country.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Table 3: Results of T-Test Comparing Jewish and Non-Jewish Reasons for Shift in Views on Israel</em></p><table class=""aligncenter"" width=""624""><tbody><tr><td width=""125"">Variable</td><td width=""96"">Means of Non-Jewish Respondents</td><td width=""96"">Means of Jewish Respondents</td><td width=""77"">Difference</td><td width=""77"">t-statistic</td><td width=""77"">Cohen’s d</td><td width=""77"">p-value</td></tr><tr><td width=""125"">Historical Event</td><td width=""96"">0.43</td><td width=""96"">0.53</td><td width=""77"">-0.10</td><td width=""77"">-1.695</td><td width=""77"">-0.200</td><td width=""77"">0.091*</td></tr><tr><td width=""125"">Media/News</td><td width=""96"">0.40</td><td width=""96"">0.44</td><td width=""77"">-0.04</td><td width=""77"">-0.657</td><td width=""77"">-0.077</td><td width=""77"">0.511</td></tr><tr><td width=""125"">Travel/Live</td><td width=""96"">0.34</td><td width=""96"">0.40</td><td width=""77"">-0.06</td><td width=""77"">-1.128</td><td width=""77"">-0.134</td><td width=""77"">0.260</td></tr><tr><td width=""125"">Palestinians</td><td width=""96"">0.38</td><td width=""96"">0.34</td><td width=""77"">0.04</td><td width=""77"">0.714</td><td width=""77"">0.085</td><td width=""77"">0.476</td></tr><tr><td width=""125"">Cultural Work</td><td width=""96"">0.19</td><td width=""96"">0.22</td><td width=""77"">-0.03</td><td width=""77"">-0.614</td><td width=""77"">-0.073</td><td width=""77"">0.539</td></tr><tr><td width=""125"">Academia</td><td width=""96"">0.09</td><td width=""96"">0.16</td><td width=""77"">-0.07</td><td width=""77"">-1.805</td><td width=""77"">-0.214</td><td width=""77"">0.072*</td></tr><tr><td width=""125"">Protest</td><td width=""96"">0.17</td><td width=""96"">0.12</td><td width=""77"">0.05</td><td width=""77"">1.133</td><td width=""77"">-0.134</td><td width=""77"">0.258</td></tr><tr><td width=""125"">Educational Event</td><td width=""96"">0.13</td><td width=""96"">0.11</td><td width=""77"">0.02</td><td width=""77"">0.555</td><td width=""77"">0.066</td><td width=""77"">0.579</td></tr><tr><td width=""125"">Interfaith Program</td><td width=""96"">0.19</td><td width=""96"">0.10</td><td width=""77"">0.09</td><td width=""77"">2.082**</td><td width=""77"">0.248</td><td width=""77"">0.038**</td></tr><tr><td width=""125"">Other</td><td width=""96"">0.15</td><td width=""96"">0.10</td><td width=""77"">0.05</td><td width=""77"">1.269</td><td width=""77"">0.150</td><td width=""77"">0.206</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""text-align: center;"">**p&lt;.05, (two-tailed test of significance) *p&lt;.1, (two-tailed test of significance)</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" class=""alignnone wp-image-7805"" data-lazy-sizes=""(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px"" data-lazy-src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-3-300x188.png"" data-lazy-srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-3-300x188.png 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-3-768x480.png 768w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-3.png 899w"" height=""270"" src=""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20431%20270'%3E%3C/svg%3E"" width=""431""/><noscript><img alt="""" class=""alignnone wp-image-7805"" height=""270"" sizes=""(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px"" src=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-3-300x188.png"" srcset=""https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-3-300x188.png 300w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-3-768x480.png 768w, https://www.arabmediasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Picture1-3.png 899w"" width=""431""/></noscript></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Figure 4. Reasons for Shift in Views on Israel</em></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Multiple studies have revealed the ways in which the American media tends to reinforce viewers’ political support for Israel and to promote the dehumanization of Palestinians (Alper and Earp 2017; Jhally and Ratzkoff 2004). Given the ways the American media is slanted towards a positive representation of Israelis and a negative representation of Palestinians, it is noteworthy that nearly half of JVP activists attribute their shifts in thinking to journalistic accounts of the conflict. On the one hand, this suggests that mainstream media sources may evoke sympathy for Palestinians among American viewers, even with their documented bias against Palestinians. On the other hand, this finding speaks to the importance of alternative news sources in educating Americans about the conflict.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><em>Media versus Planned Interventions</em></strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Jewish and non-Jewish members’ other reasons for their turning points followed a similar pattern. Both Jewish and non-Jewish activists chose “historical event,” “media/news,” “traveling or living in Israel/Palestine,” as well as “meeting Palestinians” as their top four selections; while “cultural works,” “protests,” and “educational events” came after these four primary selections for both Jews and non-Jews. The two selected reasons that held distinct levels of importance for Jewish compared to non-Jewish activists, were “academia” and “interfaith programs.” While non-Jewish JVP members ranked academia as the least common reason for their turning points, Jewish members ranked interfaith programs as the least common. The only item that produced a statistically significant difference between Jewish and non-Jewish respondents at a p value of less than .05 was the option of “interfaith programs,” with a significantly higher percentage of non-Jewish respondents reporting interfaith programs as shifting their views compared to Jewish respondents. This likely reflects the fact that Israel is frequently addressed in Jewish cultural spaces, whereas non-Jews may only have opportunities to deeply engage with the topic through programs that actively center Jewish and Muslim voices.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Together, these findings not only reinforce the salience of media in facilitating shifts among diasporic populations’ political thinking, but they also suggest the relatively weak influence of planned actions to spark ideological transformations. Rather than trace their turning points to organized interventions such as protests and educational programs, both Jewish and non-Jewish respondents were more likely to attribute changes in their political thinking to major events in Israel/Palestine and media representations of those events. Much of the research on how Jewish Americans come to embrace more critical stances on Israel/Palestine focuses on planned activities such as travel, dialogue programs, interfaith initiatives, as well as cultural and educational opportunities. Concurrently, significant resources are regularly funneled into such programs (Aviv 2011; Kelner 2010; Taylor et al. 2012; Sasson 2010; Saxe and Chazan 2008). Synagogues participate in encounter programs, individuals travel to Israel/Palestine on homeland tours, universities host cultural and academic events, and political groups organize protests and other direct actions to sway public opinion on Israel/Palestine. While each of these types of activities played an important role in some participants’ turning points, historical events and different media sources’ portrayal of those events were overwhelmingly the most frequently selected responses. This suggests that political transformations do not primarily result from planned initiatives such as the ones listed above. Instead, ideological changes appear to be more frequently prompted by socio-historical events and media coverage of those events.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Discussion</strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most respondents, both Jewish and non-Jewish, reported that they experienced a turning point in their views on Israel/Palestine. At the same time, a majority of these respondents also reported that their political views on Israel/Palestine were more or less the same before joining JVP. Together these findings suggest that most Palestine solidarity activists (both Jewish and non-Jewish) have held longstanding critical views of Israel. Their turning points then can be largely understood as catalysts to deepen and evoke activism on the issue rather than representing a total reversal of individuals’ political opinions. Nonetheless, it is clear that transformative processes play an important role in many individuals’ paths to Palestine solidarity activism. Past literature would suggest that Jewish activists, in particular, would depend on dramatic ideological transformations to become Palestinian solidarity activists. The results from this study however, demonstrate that Jewish and non-Jewish JVP activists report relatively similar rates of change in their views on Israel/Palestine.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><em>The Mundanity of Jewish Support for Palestinian Rights</em></strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">These findings generate a number of conclusions that dispel popular perceptions of Jewish activists in the Palestine solidarity movement. First, members of the Jewish diaspora who become critical of Israel appear to follow a similar ideological trajectory as non-Jews. Previous literature would predict that Jewish activists would require a higher rate of ideological transformations in order to join Palestine solidarity organizations than non-Jews. The results of this study reveal however, that Jewish and non-Jewish activists report similar rates of experiencing a turning point in their views on Israel/Palestine, and a similar degree of criticism toward Israel before joining JVP. While theoretical conceptions of critical diasporic engagement with Israel/Palestine emphasize the exceptional character of Jewish dissent, my findings suggest that Jewish identity may not play as large of a role in shifting activists’ political views as previously theorized.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">One explanation for this finding is that anti-Zionist diaspora Jews’ more critical viewpoints result from a distinct form of political socialization that differs significantly from most diaspora Jews. For example, perhaps a larger percentage of Jewish solidarity activists grew up in households with parents who were explicitly anti-Zionist, or perhaps anti-Zionist Jews are less likely to have participated in mainstream Jewish institutions like Jewish day school, summer camp, or synagogues. Alternatively, Jewish Palestine solidarity activists may <em>not </em>receive distinct forms of early political socialization compared to other American Jews. If this is the case, one might instead conclude that the barriers to American Jews becoming Palestine solidarity activists are simply not as great as many assume. However, given the fact that only two percent of American Jews support the BDS movement, and that most Jewish JVP members held views that were critical of Israel before joining JVP, it appears more likely that JVP’s Jewish activists represent a subset of the Jewish population in the United States in terms of their political backgrounds.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Although multiple surveys demonstrate that American Jews are more supportive of Israel than non-Jews, the processes by which Jewish Americans and non-Jewish Americans become involved in Palestine solidarity activism appear to be relatively similar. Both Jewish and non-Jewish activists tend to learn about events that trouble them, usually through media, and they become more critical of Israel for committing those acts. In fact, Jewish Americans were even more likely to experience turning points as a result of the media (compared to organized interventions) than non-Jewish activists. While 53 percent of Jewish JVP members attributed their turning points to historical events and 44 percent attributed it to media/news, 43 percent of non-Jewish members attributed their turning points to historical events and 40 percent attributed it to media/news.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Based on the ways that support for Israel is more deeply interwoven into American-Jewish identity compared to the general U.S population as well as the significant resources that are invested into molding Jewish Americans’ positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one would expect that planned activities (as opposed to media and historical events) would have been selected by Jews at a higher rate than non-Jews. Changing one’s mind based on media coverage implies fewer ideological obstacles to such transformations compared to political transformations that result from targeted actions. In other words, if we assume that diaspora Jews are more heavily conditioned to support the state of Israel, then it seems that something more powerful than simply learning about current events would have to take place for transformations in diaspora Jews’ views on Israel/Palestine to occur. This study, however, revealed the opposite: Jewish anti-Zionist activists were more likely to be swayed by media and different news sources as opposed to planned interventions than non-Jewish activists. Again, this could be explained by the fact that either anti-Zionist Jews represent a distinct ideological demographic compared to most American Jews, or that American Jews, in general, are not as predisposed to oppose solidarity with Palestinians as previously theorized.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">When it comes to organizing diaspora Jews to be in solidarity with Palestinians, the process of political transformation is not as central as the literature would suggest. American Jews appear to become Palestine solidarity activists in much the same way as non-Jewish Americans. Jewish activists were previously less critical of Israel at the same rate as non-Jewish activists, and the frequency at which diaspora Jews experience turning points in their views on Israel/Palestine is almost the same as non-Jews. Past research has emphasized the deeply emotional processes by which some Jews become more critical of the Israeli state. When it comes to Palestine solidarity activists, however, the data from this study suggest a relatively infrequent and unexceptional rate of troubled paths to criticism of Israel. These findings therefore challenge the assumption that intense processes of political transformation are at the root of most diaspora Jews’ involvement in the Palestine solidarity movement. Concurrently, they raise the possibility that barriers to organizing diaspora Jews in support of Palestinian rights may not be as great as previously theorized.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><em>The Importance of Media in Political Transformation</em></strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The second major finding of this study is that exposure to critical and accurate media appears to play a larger role in transforming activists’ ideologies on Israel/Palestine than planned interventions such as educational events, travel, and dialogue programs. One implication of this finding is that social change initiatives that seek to mobilize activists should avoid allocating significant resources to changing people’s mindsets about contentious issues. Instead, activist groups may have more to gain from directing their resources towards mobilizing their allies and existing ideological base. Additionally, contrary to what the literature suggests, American Jews may need even <em>less</em> “handholding” and planned interventions than non-Jews. Jewish activists were more likely than non-Jewish activists to change their minds on Israel/Palestine on account of receiving information from news sources and media compared to planned interventions. This finding suggests that more proactive engagement with alternative media platforms could lead to significant changes in the ways that diaspora Jews think about the conflict. Rather than targeting Jewish individuals through planned interventions, resources may be better spent creating and advocating for fair and comprehensive journalistic accounts of Israel/Palestine. In addition, this finding speaks to the ease with which many American Jews are forming alliances with Palestinians, thereby challenging the idea that Jewish solidarity with Palestine represents an unrealistic political goal.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another implication of this finding is that activists may be less likely to experience a turning point when they perceive themselves as being told what to think. Compared to the other options listed in Table 3 and Figure 5, media and historical events are the least directive mechanisms for shifting people’s mindsets. As such, turning points on contentious political issues appear most likely to result from experiences where the person has greater agency over their information intake. Similarly, these results speak to the importance of disseminating alternative information versus facilitating interpersonal relationships in cultivating changes in political opinions. Both scholars and peacebuilding practitioners often tout the importance of interpersonal relationships as key ingredients to ideological change (Allport 1954; Hubbard 2001; Maoz 2000; Pettigrew 1998; Ross 2017). In this study however, more people attributed their transformations to learning about events through media channels rather than social factors, i.e. relationships with Palestinians. Of course, it is difficult to determine whether a relationship set the stage for the historical/current event to be impactful or vice versa. Nonetheless, the fact that more people understand their turning points as rooted in historical events and media consumption, compared to meeting individuals of stigmatized groups, means that interpersonal encounters may not have as much of a visceral effect on how people think about the conflict as previously theorized.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">One important consideration that should be acknowledged regarding these findings is that these survey results could also reflect which types of activities people typically have access to, more so than the causal, transformative power of each particular activity. For example, a large portion of people in the United States have the ability to consume media, whereas a much smaller number of people have the means to travel to Israel/Palestine or to participate in higher education. As such, these findings may simply reflect the types of mediums that people have access to, more so than these different activities’ isolated impact. Nonetheless, even if these results are simply a reflection of access and availability, they are still useful in that they reveal how activists understand their own pathways to engagement. Furthermore, they quantitatively reflect which events are most likely to provoke change among potential activists within current social and economic constraints, thereby offering practical insights into the ways that transnational social movements may grow and succeed.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The findings of this research suggest that Jewish solidarity with Palestinians is a more organic political orientation for many American Jews than previously theorized. Not only were Jewish activists just as likely as non-Jewish activists to hold critical views of Israel before joining JVP, but Jewish activists were more likely than non-Jews to shift their thinking on Israel/Palestine because of external events and media as opposed to planned interventions. A such, Palestine solidarity organizations may benefit from moving past a strategic focus on persuading American Jews to become more critical of Israel and instead shift towards a greater emphasis on spreading information about the occupation and mobilizing their existing supporters.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">These findings also add a new layer of critique to the scholarship on planned interventions such as dialogue and peace education programs (Aouragh 2016; Abu-Nimer 2001; Gawerc 2006; Hubbard 2001; Maoz 2000; Ross 2017; Rothstein 1999; Schneider 2019). In addition to reinforcing power imbalances and being indebted to neoliberal donors, the data from this study suggest that such programs play a marginal role in building the bases of more radical organizations. In contrast to anecdotal stories of major political transformations among Jewish Palestine solidarity activists, most activists in this study appear to have long held critical views of Israel. Furthermore, when activists did experience a major shift in their thinking, it was more often due to media coverage of current events than interfaith or dialogue programs.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This study offers several broad implications that extend beyond the specific context of diaspora Jews’ solidarity with Palestine. First, media remains a powerful tool to generate solidarity with oppressed populations in the Global South. Most people who become activists do not need to be coerced into supporting such causes, instead, they need access to accurate information that informs them of injustices occurring abroad. This conclusion leads to the second wider implication of this study. Organizations that strive for radical social change may have more to gain from strengthening their existing bases than attempting to dramatically shift the mindsets of their opposition. In other words, organizations should not focus on converting its opponents at the expense of supporting those who are currently engaged in struggle. Finally, in contrast to dominant approaches to the subject of Jewish support for Palestinians, this study suggests that Jewish solidarity with Palestine is not typically the result of hard-won ideological conversion, it is instead an accessible, and even obvious, political orientation for many American Jews.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This research would not have been possible without the support of Samantha Brotman at Jewish Voice for Peace as well as Jamie Baum, whose 2018 senior thesis provided the groundwork for this article’s statistical analyses.</p><h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Works Cited</strong></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Abu-Nimer, Mohammed. 2001. <em>Reconciliation, Justice, and Coexistence: Theory and Practice. </em>Lanham: Lexington Books.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ages, A. 1973. <em>The Diaspora Dimension</em>.

This study finds American Jews tend to attribute their support for Palestine to historical events and media rather than planned activities such as interfaith dialogue and awareness-raising initiatives. In addition, despite popular perceptions that understand Jewish Americans\u2019 paths to supporting Palestinians as uniquely arduous, my data suggest that most Jewish activists in the Palestine solidarity movement did not go through major ideological transformations to arrive at their positions. Instead, support for Palestine appears to be more ideologically accessible to Jewish activists than previously theorized. These findings suggest that media can serve as a powerful force to reorganize diasporic commitments and generate transnational support for justice and peace in the Arab world. They also imply that Western support for anticolonial struggles in the Middle East is more likely to be won through accurately reporting on such events rather than more targeted interventions designed to change people\u2019s minds. While many social change organizations devote considerable resources to shifting the thinking of people who oppose their cause, my data suggest that such resources may be better spent mobilizing these groups\u2019 existing bases.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nIn Jewish community centers, schools, and synagogues throughout the United States, American Jews are socialized to identify as members of a diaspora that centers Israel as the Jewish homeland. This process is undergirded by economic and political forces that incentivize American Jews to support the state of Israel which in turn, often lead Jewish Americans to side with Israel in its conflict with the Palestinians. The 2020 Pew study of Jewish Americans, for example, found that 82 percent of Jews consider caring about Israel to be either an important or essential part of their Jewish identity, and the majority of American Jews reported feeling very or at least somewhat attached to Israel (Pew Research Center). Furthermore, while only two percent of American Jews strongly support the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions (BDS) movement (a clear indicator of political solidarity with Palestinians), 34 percent strongly oppose it.\r\nDespite this context, a growing contingent of American Jews are mobilizing in support of Palestinians\u2019 rights and against the state of Israel. One of the organizations at the center of this activism is Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP). According to their mission statement:\r\n\r\n\r\nJVP seeks an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem; security and self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians; a just solution for Palestinian refugees based on principles established in international law; an end to violence against civilians; and peace and justice for all peoples of the Middle East (Jewish Voice for Peace).\r\n\r\nJVP has over 70 local chapters and more than 200,000 supporters. In addition, the organization includes a Rabbinic Council, an Artist Council, an Academic Advisory Council, a youth wing, as well as an advisory board comprised of high-profile public figures. In recent years, JVP has experienced significant growth, with their $400,000 budget in 2009 rising to nearly $3 million in 2021 (Jewish Voice for Peace).\r\nThis study analyzes data from a survey of JVP\u2019s national members in order to understand the factors that lead American Jews to support the Palestinian cause. The results of the survey (n=690) show that a majority of JVP members experienced a turning point in their political views on Israel\/Palestine. Surprisingly, the results also reveal that Jewish members of JVP experienced ideological turning points at roughly the same rate as non-Jewish members. The data further suggest that most JVP members, both Jewish and non-Jewish, overwhelmingly attributed the cause of their turning points to historical events and the media\u2019s portrayal of those events. These findings speak to the power of media in shaping transnational political action through facilitating ideological transformations among diaspora groups. They also challenge the idea that Jewish identity hinders individuals\u2019 involvement in Palestine solidarity activism. Contrary to past research and popular perceptions, the process of ideological transformation on Israel\/Palestine appears to be quite similar for both Jewish and non-Jewish activists in the Palestine solidarity movement.\r\n\r\nDiaspora and Zionism\r\nIn many ways, Jews are the quintessential diaspora group, with the term often used to directly describe the Jewish people\u2019s millennia-old history of exile and transnational community (Ages 1973). More generally, diaspora refers to any group that is scattered throughout the world from their historical homeland and still maintains a common bond of ethnicity, religion, culture, and\/or national identity (Coles and Timothy 2004). Current conceptions of Jewish diaspora that locate this historical homeland within the state of Israel are rooted in the rise of the Zionist movement (Smith 1988). Although early Zionists entertained several locations for the Jewish state, Zionism today generally refers to a Jewish state in Israel\/Palestine (Spangler 2015). As such, Zionism is often conceptualized as the return of the Jewish people to their ancient, biblical homeland, Eretz Yisrael. As the Israeli National Anthem goes:\r\n\r\n\r\nAs long as within our hearts The Jewish soul sings,\r\nAs long as forward to the East To Zion, looks the eye \u2013\r\nOur hope is not yet lost,\r\nIt is two thousand years old,\r\nTo be a free people in our land The land of Zion and Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nNearly half of American Jews have traveled to Israel, with those under 35 often first traveling there on an organized homeland tour called Birthright. Founded in 1999, Birthright has brought over 750,000 young people with Jewish lineage on free ten-day tours to Israel (Birthright Israel). The program, which targets 18 to 26-year-olds, has become a cornerstone of the Jewish-American experience, and a rite of passage for many Jewish-American millennials (Saxe and Chazan 2008). On these trips, young American Jews are further socialized into supporting the state of Israel through touristic activities that emphasize the Jewish people\u2019s ancient, diasporic connection to the land of Israel.\r\nIn contrast to such mainstream approaches to Jewish nationhood, scholars such as Boyarin and Boyarin (2003) have argued for the revival of diaspora, not Zionism, as the central, organizing tenet of Jewish identity. According to Boyarin and Boyarin, Jewish identity should move away from a focus on geography, and instead celebrate the de-territorialized, generational connections among Jews that have functioned to preserve ancient beliefs and traditions. Instead of striving for a \u201cproud resting place,\u201d they suggest that Jewish identity should be defined by a permanent state of dispersal, composed of \u201cperpetual, creative, diasporic, tension\u201d (Boyarin and Boyarin 2003, 103). Stuart Hall (1994) similarly rejects the centrality of collective, physical return in his conception of diaspora. Like Boyarin and Boyarin, Hall prioritizes the experience of diaspora rather than the elimination of diasporic exile. As he explains:\r\n\r\n\r\n[D]iaspora does not refer us to those scattered tribes whose identity can only be secured in relation to some sacred homeland to which they must at all costs return, even if it means pushing other people into the sea\u2026 this is the old, the imperialising, the hegemonising, form of 'ethnicity'. We have seen the fate of the people of Palestine at the hands of this backward-looking conception of diaspora - and the complicity of the West with it. (Hall 1994, 235).\r\n\r\nIn this quote, Hall directly refers to the ongoing displacement and oppression of the Palestinian people that has resulted from the Zionist movement. While Zionism is often presented as a movement for self-determination of the Jewish people, it is also settler-colonial force, as Palestine was inhabited by over half a million Palestinians, most of whom were forcibly expelled, at the time of Zionist settlement (Halper 2021; Khalidi 1991; Mamdani 2020; Papp\u00e9 2007; Sekaily 2015).\r\nAs a result of Israeli settler colonialism, Palestinians have now lived under a direct military occupation for over half a century. Numerous international agencies and local organizations have documented the plethora of human rights abuses that occur on a daily basis in the Occupied Territories. For example, despite Israeli citizens\u2019 ability to move freely between Israel-proper and the West Bank, Palestinians\u2019 movement is blocked by hundreds of Israeli checkpoints, road blocks, and closures. These obstructions to Palestinian movement not only cause humiliation and violence, but they also produce economic stagnation, serve as a mechanism for land confiscation, and facilitate Israeli control and surveillance (Gordon 2008; Halper 2021; Khalili 2012). Despite this extreme imbalance of power and the disproportionate number of Palestinian casualties from the conflict, 58 percent of Americans report that they sympathize with Israelis, while only 25 percent more strongly sympathize with Palestinians (Saad 2021). As previously discussed, support for Israel is even more pronounced among American Jews. Rather than simply being a matter of politics, allegiance to Israel is deeply woven into many Jewish Americans\u2019 senses of identity and connections to Judaism (Waxman 2016).\r\n\r\nDissent in the Diaspora\r\nWhile most American Jews hold favorable views towards Israel, a growing number of American Jews are resisting their communities\u2019 support for Israel and are mobilizing in solidarity with Palestinians. This shift has a generational character, as younger American Jews are diverging from previous generations\u2019 seemingly unequivocal support for Israel (Cohen and Kelman 2010; Sasson 2010; Waxman 2017). According to the Pew study:\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung U.S. Jews are less emotionally attached to Israel than older ones. As of 2020, half of Jewish adults under age 30 describe themselves as very or somewhat emotionally attached to Israel (48%), compared with two-thirds of Jews ages 65 and older (Pew Research Center).\r\n\r\nSeveral scholars attribute this shift to the \u201cdistancing hypothesis,\u201d which asserts that young Jews are less attached to Israel than previous generations (Cohen and Kelman 2010). Other scholars, however, maintain that young Jews\u2019 more critical stances represent a deeper engagement with Israel, rather than alienation from it (Sasson et al. 2010; Waxman 2017). Regardless as to which interpretation more accurately describes this trend, Jewish communities across the United States are nonetheless being forced to grapple with growing internal resistance to Zionism.\r\nOne of the clearest manifestations of this trend is the recent proliferation of nonprofit organizations that aim to mobilize the Jewish-American population into a more critical relationship towards the Israeli state. In 2007, J Street, the first liberal \u201cpro-Israel, pro-peace\u201d lobby of its size entered the political scene. J Street\u2019s mission statement reads, \u201cJ Street organizes pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans to promote US policies that embody our deeply held Jewish and democratic values and that help secure the State of Israel as a democratic homeland for the Jewish people.\u201d (J Street). J Street is adamant about being characterized as a pro-Israel organization, and clearly affirms its belief in the Zionist ideal of a Jewish homeland. Despite this, J Street\u2019s inclusion in \u201cpro-Israel\u201d spaces continues to be a point of controversy, which has resulted in repeated instances of J Street being ousted from Jewish federations, synagogues, and campus groups (e.g., Elsner 2018; Grubaugh 2013; Sokol and Shwayder 2014).\r\nFive years after J Street was founded, Open Hillel, a student-led initiative, was formed after Harvard\u2019s Progressive Jewish Alliance (PJA) was barred from co-hosting a panel with the Palestine Solidarity Committee entitled \u201cJewish Voices Against the Occupation.\u201d To justify its stance, Hillel (the Foundation for Jewish Campus Life) cited its guidelines of not allowing chapters to partner with, house, or host organizations, groups, or speakers who:\r\n\r\n\r\n \tDeny the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish and democratic state with secure and recognized borders\r\n \tDelegitimize, demonize, or apply a double standard to Israel\r\n \tSupport boycott of, divestment from, or sanctions against the State of Israel\r\n \tExhibit a pattern of disruptive behavior towards campus events or guest speakers or foster an atmosphere of incivility (Hillel, n.d.).\r\n\r\nOn account of such restrictions, the Open Hillel movement accused Hillel International of creating a litmus test for inclusion in Jewish campus communities based on students\u2019 support for Israel. Students from across the country identified with the group\u2019s critiques, and joined the movement to begin pushing for more inclusive Hillel guidelines while resisting Hillel\u2019s attempts to silence critics of Israel (Open Hillel, n.d.).\r\nThough formed in 1996, Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) has experienced massive growth in recent years, with some calling it the fastest growing Jewish organization in the United States (Halper 2021). As JVP continues to increase its membership, its politics have moved steadily to the left. In 2011, JVP members voted to officially endorse Palestinian civil society\u2019s call to support the BDS movement, and in 2018, JVP issued a statement announcing its official opposition to Zionism. JVP\u2019s political stances position them outside the margins of most mainstream Jewish-American approaches to Israel\/Palestine, and within the realm of Palestinian solidarity activism. Still, in spite of their relative distance from mainstream Jewish institutional thought, JVP continues to grow as a prominent force for U.S.-based Jewish solidarity with the Palestinian people.\r\nAs a political \u201cmiddle-ground\u201d between J Street and Jewish Voice for Peace, If Not Now was founded in 2014 in response to that year\u2019s major Israeli assault on Gaza. Today, If Not Now serves as an activist home for many young Jewish Americans who oppose Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. While J Street focuses more heavily on institutional channels of change at the government level, and JVP embraces traditional solidarity politics, If Not Now focuses specifically on shifting the political climate within the Jewish American community through education, direct action, and targeted political campaigns. Unlike J Street and JVP, If Not Now directs their activism exclusively towards Jewish-American support for the occupation. For example, If Not Now launched their #YouNeverToldMe campaign to encourage young Jews to share personal stories of problematic Israel education programs as well as their #NotJustAFreeTrip campaign, which focused on critiquing Birthright.\r\n\r\nMethods and Case Study: Jewish Voice for Peace\r\nThis analysis focuses specifically on Jewish Voice for Peace as a case study to understand how diaspora Jews become involved in Palestine solidarity activism. Since JVP\u2019s members represent some of the most engaged and steadfast Jewish critics of Israel, their paths to activism provide a useful lens into the processes that facilitate engagement with the Palestinian cause among American Jews. Given the ways that many American Jews are socialized to understand themselves as members of a diaspora that should support the Israeli state, this study uses the case of JVP to identify which factors may motivate Jewish Americans to reformulate their relationships to Israel\/Palestine. Specifically, I collaborated with staff members at JVP to include a series of questions on their 2015 membership survey that was then used to analyze their members\u2019 political views and ideological transformations on Israel\/Palestine.\r\nJewish members of JVP vary in terms of their relationships to Judaism and how they understand the concept of a Jewish diaspora. In 2017, JVP\u2019s New York chapter published a book entitled, Confronting Zionism: A Collection of Personal Stories (Jewish Voice for Peace NYC 2017). In these stories, JVP members detail the ways that they were raised to see themselves as members of a Jewish diaspora that centered Israel as their homeland. For example, as Talia Baurer writes, \u201cI grew up knowing that Israel was my homeland, that I had deep biblical and historical roots there, and that its existence made me safer in the world \u2013 among other insidious mythologies.\u201d In 2019, JVP launched a monthly podcast entitled Diaspora. In the series, various JVP members share accounts of how they were taught to associate their Jewish identity with Israel and to embrace traditional conceptions of Zionism. While there are certainly some members of JVP whose relationships to Judaism and diaspora are less pronounced, these cultural products highlight the large number of JVP members who identify as diaspora Jews.\r\nBased on anecdotal accounts such as those detailed above as well as national polls that demonstrate overwhelming support for Israel within the Jewish community, one would suspect that Jewish activists would experience more arduous paths to supporting the Palestinian cause than non-Jewish Palestine solidarity activists. In order to explore this hypothesis, a series of questions were developed and included on the JVP national membership survey. The first of these questions asked JVP members, \u201cBefore becoming a JVP supporter, your political views on Israel\/Palestine were:\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n \tThe same as they are today more or less.\r\n \tSlightly less critical of Israel.\r\n \tMuch more supportive of Israel.\r\n \tMore critical of Israel ([1]).\r\n\r\nRespondents who answered \u201cslightly less critical of Israel\u201d and \u201cmuch more supportive of Israel\u201d were combined to form a single variable of \u201cless critical of Israel before joining the organization.\u201d This created a dichotomous variable to compare those who were previously less critical of Israel to those who had similar views of Israel before joining JVP. Next, respondents were asked, \u201cWas there ever a turning point(s) in your activism or views on Israel\/Palestine?\u201d - Yes or No. If respondents answered \u201cYes,\u201d they were then asked, \u201cWhat caused the shift in your views\/opinions about Palestine\/Israel?\u201d\r\nThe survey was sent via email to all of JVP\u2019s members (about 6,000 individuals). The survey had around an 11 percent response rate, with 680 people completing the online questionnaire. Of these 680 responses, 501 individuals, who met the criteria for analysis([2]), responded to the question regarding their views on Israel before joining JVP and 487 responded to the turning point question. Of the 332 respondents who answered \u201cyes\u201d to having experienced a turning point, 276 responded to the follow-up question \u2013 \u201cWhat caused the shift in your views\/opinions about Israel\/Palestine?\u201d The options for this question included:\r\n\r\n\r\n \tExposure to different media\/news outlets\r\n \tSeeing\/participating in an [organization] or other group\u2019s protest online or in-person\r\n \tAttending a local [organization] or other group\u2019s educational event\r\n \tExperiencing a particular cultural work \u2013 book, film, play, dance, article, etc.\r\n \tA specific historical event (war, intifada, etc.)\r\n \tAn academic experience \u2013 class, lecture, etc.\r\n \tMeeting\/speaking with Palestinians\r\n \tAn interfaith\/dialogue\/educational program\r\n \tTraveling to or living in Israel\/Palestine\r\n \tOther (fill in the blank)\r\n\r\nMany respondents selected more than one option due to the \u2018select all that apply\u2019 nature of the question. About half of the respondents to the survey identified as Jewish, while the other half did not. To compare the responses of these two groups, multivariate logistic regression and t-tests were conducted to analyze the results of the survey.\r\n\r\nFindings\r\nSimilarities Between Jews and Non-Jews\u2019 Previous Views\r\nAs seen below in Table 1 and Figure 1, Jewish and non-Jewish JVP members\u2019 answers to the question of \u201cBefore becoming a JVP supporter, your political views on Israel\/Palestine were:\u201d followed similar patterns. About 75 percent of Jewish JVP members had the same level of critique of Israel before joining JVP, whereas about 25 percent were less critical of Israel before joining JVP. Non-Jewish JVP members had an almost identical breakdown, also with about 75 percent having the same level of critique before joining JVP and about 25 percent being less critical before joining the organization.\r\nTable 1: Respondents\u2019 Level of Critique of Israel Before Joining the Organization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n% (n)\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal (n=501)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Same Level of Critique\r\n75.05 (376)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Less Critical Before\r\n24.95 (125)\r\n\r\n\r\nJewish (n=250)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Same Level of Critique\r\n75.20 (188)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Less Critical Before\r\n24.80 (62)\r\n\r\n\r\nNot Jewish (n=251)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Same Level of Critique\r\n74.90 (188)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Less Critical Before\r\n25.10 (63)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Views on Israel Before Joining the Organization\r\nGiven the ways that American Jews are socialized to support the state of Israel, one would expect that Jewish respondents would have been less critical of Israel prior to joining JVP compared to non-Jewish members. While support for Israel is common across the entire American population, Jewish Americans consistently express higher rates of support for Israel than the general population, and this support is often interwoven into individuals\u2019 sense of a diasporic identity. In a poll administered by the Ruderman Family Foundation\u00a0of 2,500 American Jews, about two-thirds of respondents reported that they are emotionally \u201cattached\u201d or \u201cvery attached\u201d to Israel, and four out of five respondents identified as \u201cpro-Israel\u201d (Winter 2020). As such, one would expect that a significantly larger proportion of Jewish JVP members would have previously been less critical of Israel prior to joining JVP compared to non-Jewish members. Instead, the data showed a similar division between those who were previously less critical of Israel and those who had the same level of critique before joining the organization for Jews and non-Jews.\r\nIt is also surprising that a large proportion of JVP members (both Jewish and non-Jewish) had relatively similar views on Israel\/Palestine before joining JVP compared to their political views today. According to a 2018 Gallup poll (see Figure 2), 65 percent of U.S citizens answered \u201cIsraelis\u201d to the question of \u201cIn the Middle East, are your sympathies more with Israelis or more with Palestinians?\u201d In contrast, only 19 percent of people answered \u201cPalestinians.\u201d These statistics would suggest that most Americans would need to experience a significant shift in their political thinking to support an organization like JVP, since people in the United States are more likely to be conditioned to support Israelis over Palestinians. In other words, because dominant political frameworks on Israel\/Palestine in the United States tend to facilitate widespread support for Israelis over Palestinians, one might assume that someone who came to support an organization like JVP would have previously been less critical of Israel.\r\n\r\nFigure 2: 2018 Gallup Poll \u201cIn the Middle East, are your sympathies more with Israelis or more with Palestinians?\r\nThis finding is especially surprising for Jewish JVP members. According to the aforementioned 2020 Pew Study, 82 percent of Jews consider caring about Israel to be either an important or essential part of their Jewish identity (Pew Research Center). An even clearer indication of Jewish Americans\u2019 support for Israel is seen in the 2018 Jewish Electorate\u2019s Survey, which showed that 92 percent of Jewish voters consider themselves to be some variant of \u201cpro-Israel\u201d (Morganti 2020). Given these statistics, it is particularly noteworthy that so many Jewish members were already critical of Israel before joining JVP.\r\nThese findings were corroborated by respondents\u2019 answers to the question of whether they experienced a turning point in their views on Israel\/Palestine (see Table 2 and Figure 3). Again, one would expect that Jewish respondents would go through turning points at a higher rate than the non-Jewish participants, since most American Jews politically identify with Israel and would therefore need to experience a significant ideological transformation to become Palestine solidarity activists. In contrast, however, both Jewish and non-Jewish JVP members expressed relatively similar rates of experiencing a turning point in their views on Israel\/Palestine. While 69 percent of Jews experienced a turning point, 67 percent of non-Jews experienced one as well. Although Jews experienced a turning point at a slightly higher rate than non-Jews, this difference was not statistically significant and therefore does not appear to represent a meaningful difference.\r\nTable 2: Rates of Turning Points\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n% (n)\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal (n=487)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Turning Point\r\n68.17 (332)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 No Turning Point\r\n31.83 (155)\r\n\r\n\r\nJewish (n=242)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Turning Point\r\n69.42 (168)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 No Turning Point\r\n30.58 (74)\r\n\r\n\r\nNot Jewish (n=245)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Turning Point\r\n66.94 (164)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 No Turning Point\r\n33.06 (81)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3. Turning Points Among Jewish Versus Non-Jewish JVP Members\r\nAnalyzed together with the previous results on criticism of Israel before joining JVP, these findings suggest that contrary to what the existing literature on Jewish Americans\u2019 relationships to Israel would imply, Jews who join organizations that are highly critical of Israel do not appear to have gone through transformative processes at higher rates than the non-Jewish members of those organizations. In other words, diaspora Jews involved in Palestine solidarity organizations do not change their political views on Israel\/Palestine before becoming activists at significantly higher rates than the non-Jewish members of those organizations. While these data cannot speak to whether those transformations were perhaps more intense for Jewish respondents \u2013 they do reveal a surprising result, that Jewish and non-Jewish activists go through a turning point in their views on Israel\/Palestine at similar rates.\r\n\r\nTurning Points and Media\r\nIn contrast to the first finding that seemed to suggest that most respondents did not go through a significant political transformation regarding their views on Israel\/Palestine, most respondents (both Jewish and non-Jewish) answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question of \u201cwas there ever a turning point(s) in your activism or views on Israel\/Palestine?\u201d As previously discussed, national polls suggest that around 65 percent of Americans express support for Israelis over Palestinians. This aligns with the survey data that shows that around 67 percent of non-Jewish JVP members experienced a turning point around their views on Israel\/Palestine. In theory, if JVP members reflect wider attitudinal trends in U.S society, one would expect for about two-thirds of its members to experience a shift in thinking, which is what the data showed.\r\nThese findings suggest that there is not a significant difference in terms of the prevalence of ideological turning points between Jewish and non-Jewish Palestine solidarity activists. Jewish activists only experience turning points at a slightly higher rate than non-Jewish activists, and this difference was not statistically significant. These findings therefore challenge recent academic scholarship that centers overcoming Zionism in diaspora Jews\u2019 support for Palestinians (Omer 2019; Schneider 2019; Waxman 2016). In addition, these findings suggest that it is quite common for both Jewish and non-Jewish pro-Palestinian activists to experience a turning point in their views on Israel\/Palestine. This result then begs the question of which factors are most likely to facilitate such turning points.\r\nAs seen in Table\u00a03 and Figure\u00a04, the most common reasons that respondents attributed to their shift in views on Israel\/Palestine were historical events([3]) and media. Given the fact that historical\/current events are often learned about through various types of media, it appears that most activists changed their positions on Israel\/Palestine because of media coverage of the conflict. Even more so than non-Jews, Jewish activists overwhelmingly attributed their turning points on Israel\/Palestine to historical events and the media. Accordingly, these findings speak to the power of media in shaping transnational political allegiances among diaspora groups, in that media coverage of current events may have the ability to reorganize diaspora groups\u2019 political relationships to a base state and to make them more critical of a \u201chomeland\u201d country.\r\nTable 3: Results of T-Test Comparing Jewish and Non-Jewish Reasons for Shift in Views on Israel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariable\r\nMeans of Non-Jewish Respondents\r\nMeans of Jewish Respondents\r\nDifference\r\nt-statistic\r\nCohen\u2019s d\r\np-value\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical Event\r\n0.43\r\n0.53\r\n-0.10\r\n-1.695\r\n-0.200\r\n0.091*\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia\/News\r\n0.40\r\n0.44\r\n-0.04\r\n-0.657\r\n-0.077\r\n0.511\r\n\r\n\r\nTravel\/Live\r\n0.34\r\n0.40\r\n-0.06\r\n-1.128\r\n-0.134\r\n0.260\r\n\r\n\r\nPalestinians\r\n0.38\r\n0.34\r\n0.04\r\n0.714\r\n0.085\r\n0.476\r\n\r\n\r\nCultural Work\r\n0.19\r\n0.22\r\n-0.03\r\n-0.614\r\n-0.073\r\n0.539\r\n\r\n\r\nAcademia\r\n0.09\r\n0.16\r\n-0.07\r\n-1.805\r\n-0.214\r\n0.072*\r\n\r\n\r\nProtest\r\n0.17\r\n0.12\r\n0.05\r\n1.133\r\n-0.134\r\n0.258\r\n\r\n\r\nEducational Event\r\n0.13\r\n0.11\r\n0.02\r\n0.555\r\n0.066\r\n0.579\r\n\r\n\r\nInterfaith Program\r\n0.19\r\n0.10\r\n0.09\r\n2.082**\r\n0.248\r\n0.038**\r\n\r\n\r\nOther\r\n0.15\r\n0.10\r\n0.05\r\n1.269\r\n0.150\r\n0.206\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**p&lt;.05, (two-tailed test of significance) *p&lt;.1, (two-tailed test of significance)\r\n\r\nFigure 4. Reasons for Shift in Views on Israel\r\nMultiple studies have revealed the ways in which the American media tends to reinforce viewers\u2019 political support for Israel and to promote the dehumanization of Palestinians (Alper and Earp 2017; Jhally and Ratzkoff 2004). Given the ways the American media is slanted towards a positive representation of Israelis and a negative representation of Palestinians, it is noteworthy that nearly half of JVP activists attribute their shifts in thinking to journalistic accounts of the conflict. On the one hand, this suggests that mainstream media sources may evoke sympathy for Palestinians among American viewers, even with their documented bias against Palestinians. On the other hand, this finding speaks to the importance of alternative news sources in educating Americans about the conflict.\r\n\r\nMedia versus Planned Interventions\r\nJewish and non-Jewish members\u2019 other reasons for their turning points followed a similar pattern. Both Jewish and non-Jewish activists chose \u201chistorical event,\u201d \u201cmedia\/news,\u201d \u201ctraveling or living in Israel\/Palestine,\u201d as well as \u201cmeeting Palestinians\u201d as their top four selections; while \u201ccultural works,\u201d \u201cprotests,\u201d and \u201ceducational events\u201d came after these four primary selections for both Jews and non-Jews. The two selected reasons that held distinct levels of importance for Jewish compared to non-Jewish activists, were \u201cacademia\u201d and \u201cinterfaith programs.\u201d While non-Jewish JVP members ranked academia as the least common reason for their turning points, Jewish members ranked interfaith programs as the least common. The only item that produced a statistically significant difference between Jewish and non-Jewish respondents at a p value of less than .05 was the option of \u201cinterfaith programs,\u201d with a significantly higher percentage of non-Jewish respondents reporting interfaith programs as shifting their views compared to Jewish respondents. This likely reflects the fact that Israel is frequently addressed in Jewish cultural spaces, whereas non-Jews may only have opportunities to deeply engage with the topic through programs that actively center Jewish and Muslim voices.\r\nTogether, these findings not only reinforce the salience of media in facilitating shifts among diasporic populations\u2019 political thinking, but they also suggest the relatively weak influence of planned actions to spark ideological transformations. Rather than trace their turning points to organized interventions such as protests and educational programs, both Jewish and non-Jewish respondents were more likely to attribute changes in their political thinking to major events in Israel\/Palestine and media representations of those events. Much of the research on how Jewish Americans come to embrace more critical stances on Israel\/Palestine focuses on planned activities such as travel, dialogue programs, interfaith initiatives, as well as cultural and educational opportunities. Concurrently, significant resources are regularly funneled into such programs (Aviv 2011; Kelner 2010; Taylor et al. 2012; Sasson 2010; Saxe and Chazan 2008). Synagogues participate in encounter programs, individuals travel to Israel\/Palestine on homeland tours, universities host cultural and academic events, and political groups organize protests and other direct actions to sway public opinion on Israel\/Palestine. While each of these types of activities played an important role in some participants\u2019 turning points, historical events and different media sources\u2019 portrayal of those events were overwhelmingly the most frequently selected responses. This suggests that political transformations do not primarily result from planned initiatives such as the ones listed above. Instead, ideological changes appear to be more frequently prompted by socio-historical events and media coverage of those events.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nMost respondents, both Jewish and non-Jewish, reported that they experienced a turning point in their views on Israel\/Palestine. At the same time, a majority of these respondents also reported that their political views on Israel\/Palestine were more or less the same before joining JVP. Together these findings suggest that most Palestine solidarity activists (both Jewish and non-Jewish) have held longstanding critical views of Israel. Their turning points then can be largely understood as catalysts to deepen and evoke activism on the issue rather than representing a total reversal of individuals\u2019 political opinions. Nonetheless, it is clear that transformative processes play an important role in many individuals\u2019 paths to Palestine solidarity activism. Past literature would suggest that Jewish activists, in particular, would depend on dramatic ideological transformations to become Palestinian solidarity activists. The results from this study however, demonstrate that Jewish and non-Jewish JVP activists report relatively similar rates of change in their views on Israel\/Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe Mundanity of Jewish Support for Palestinian Rights\r\nThese findings generate a number of conclusions that dispel popular perceptions of Jewish activists in the Palestine solidarity movement. First, members of the Jewish diaspora who become critical of Israel appear to follow a similar ideological trajectory as non-Jews. Previous literature would predict that Jewish activists would require a higher rate of ideological transformations in order to join Palestine solidarity organizations than non-Jews. The results of this study reveal however, that Jewish and non-Jewish activists report similar rates of experiencing a turning point in their views on Israel\/Palestine, and a similar degree of criticism toward Israel before joining JVP. While theoretical conceptions of critical diasporic engagement with Israel\/Palestine emphasize the exceptional character of Jewish dissent, my findings suggest that Jewish identity may not play as large of a role in shifting activists\u2019 political views as previously theorized.\r\nOne explanation for this finding is that anti-Zionist diaspora Jews\u2019 more critical viewpoints result from a distinct form of political socialization that differs significantly from most diaspora Jews. For example, perhaps a larger percentage of Jewish solidarity activists grew up in households with parents who were explicitly anti-Zionist, or perhaps anti-Zionist Jews are less likely to have participated in mainstream Jewish institutions like Jewish day school, summer camp, or synagogues. Alternatively, Jewish Palestine solidarity activists may not receive distinct forms of early political socialization compared to other American Jews. If this is the case, one might instead conclude that the barriers to American Jews becoming Palestine solidarity activists are simply not as great as many assume. However, given the fact that only two percent of American Jews support the BDS movement, and that most Jewish JVP members held views that were critical of Israel before joining JVP, it appears more likely that JVP\u2019s Jewish activists represent a subset of the Jewish population in the United States in terms of their political backgrounds.\r\nAlthough multiple surveys demonstrate that American Jews are more supportive of Israel than non-Jews, the processes by which Jewish Americans and non-Jewish Americans become involved in Palestine solidarity activism appear to be relatively similar. Both Jewish and non-Jewish activists tend to learn about events that trouble them, usually through media, and they become more critical of Israel for committing those acts. In fact, Jewish Americans were even more likely to experience turning points as a result of the media (compared to organized interventions) than non-Jewish activists. While 53 percent of Jewish JVP members attributed their turning points to historical events and 44 percent attributed it to media\/news, 43 percent of non-Jewish members attributed their turning points to historical events and 40 percent attributed it to media\/news.\r\nBased on the ways that support for Israel is more deeply interwoven into American-Jewish identity compared to the general U.S population as well as the significant resources that are invested into molding Jewish Americans\u2019 positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one would expect that planned activities (as opposed to media and historical events) would have been selected by Jews at a higher rate than non-Jews. Changing one\u2019s mind based on media coverage implies fewer ideological obstacles to such transformations compared to political transformations that result from targeted actions. In other words, if we assume that diaspora Jews are more heavily conditioned to support the state of Israel, then it seems that something more powerful than simply learning about current events would have to take place for transformations in diaspora Jews\u2019 views on Israel\/Palestine to occur. This study, however, revealed the opposite: Jewish anti-Zionist activists were more likely to be swayed by media and different news sources as opposed to planned interventions than non-Jewish activists. Again, this could be explained by the fact that either anti-Zionist Jews represent a distinct ideological demographic compared to most American Jews, or that American Jews, in general, are not as predisposed to oppose solidarity with Palestinians as previously theorized.\r\nWhen it comes to organizing diaspora Jews to be in solidarity with Palestinians, the process of political transformation is not as central as the literature would suggest. American Jews appear to become Palestine solidarity activists in much the same way as non-Jewish Americans. Jewish activists were previously less critical of Israel at the same rate as non-Jewish activists, and the frequency at which diaspora Jews experience turning points in their views on Israel\/Palestine is almost the same as non-Jews. Past research has emphasized the deeply emotional processes by which some Jews become more critical of the Israeli state. When it comes to Palestine solidarity activists, however, the data from this study suggest a relatively infrequent and unexceptional rate of troubled paths to criticism of Israel. These findings therefore challenge the assumption that intense processes of political transformation are at the root of most diaspora Jews\u2019 involvement in the Palestine solidarity movement. Concurrently, they raise the possibility that barriers to organizing diaspora Jews in support of Palestinian rights may not be as great as previously theorized.\r\n\r\nThe Importance of Media in Political Transformation\r\nThe second major finding of this study is that exposure to critical and accurate media appears to play a larger role in transforming activists\u2019 ideologies on Israel\/Palestine than planned interventions such as educational events, travel, and dialogue programs. One implication of this finding is that social change initiatives that seek to mobilize activists should avoid allocating significant resources to changing people\u2019s mindsets about contentious issues. Instead, activist groups may have more to gain from directing their resources towards mobilizing their allies and existing ideological base. Additionally, contrary to what the literature suggests, American Jews may need even less \u201chandholding\u201d and planned interventions than non-Jews. Jewish activists were more likely than non-Jewish activists to change their minds on Israel\/Palestine on account of receiving information from news sources and media compared to planned interventions. This finding suggests that more proactive engagement with alternative media platforms could lead to significant changes in the ways that diaspora Jews think about the conflict. Rather than targeting Jewish individuals through planned interventions, resources may be better spent creating and advocating for fair and comprehensive journalistic accounts of Israel\/Palestine. In addition, this finding speaks to the ease with which many American Jews are forming alliances with Palestinians, thereby challenging the idea that Jewish solidarity with Palestine represents an unrealistic political goal.\r\nAnother implication of this finding is that activists may be less likely to experience a turning point when they perceive themselves as being told what to think. Compared to the other options listed in Table 3 and Figure 5, media and historical events are the least directive mechanisms for shifting people\u2019s mindsets. As such, turning points on contentious political issues appear most likely to result from experiences where the person has greater agency over their information intake. Similarly, these results speak to the importance of disseminating alternative information versus facilitating interpersonal relationships in cultivating changes in political opinions. Both scholars and peacebuilding practitioners often tout the importance of interpersonal relationships as key ingredients to ideological change (Allport 1954; Hubbard 2001; Maoz 2000; Pettigrew 1998; Ross 2017). In this study however, more people attributed their transformations to learning about events through media channels rather than social factors, i.e. relationships with Palestinians. Of course, it is difficult to determine whether a relationship set the stage for the historical\/current event to be impactful or vice versa. Nonetheless, the fact that more people understand their turning points as rooted in historical events and media consumption, compared to meeting individuals of stigmatized groups, means that interpersonal encounters may not have as much of a visceral effect on how people think about the conflict as previously theorized.\r\nOne important consideration that should be acknowledged regarding these findings is that these survey results could also reflect which types of activities people typically have access to, more so than the causal, transformative power of each particular activity. For example, a large portion of people in the United States have the ability to consume media, whereas a much smaller number of people have the means to travel to Israel\/Palestine or to participate in higher education. As such, these findings may simply reflect the types of mediums that people have access to, more so than these different activities\u2019 isolated impact. Nonetheless, even if these results are simply a reflection of access and availability, they are still useful in that they reveal how activists understand their own pathways to engagement. Furthermore, they quantitatively reflect which events are most likely to provoke change among potential activists within current social and economic constraints, thereby offering practical insights into the ways that transnational social movements may grow and succeed.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe findings of this research suggest that Jewish solidarity with Palestinians is a more organic political orientation for many American Jews than previously theorized. Not only were Jewish activists just as likely as non-Jewish activists to hold critical views of Israel before joining JVP, but Jewish activists were more likely than non-Jews to shift their thinking on Israel\/Palestine because of external events and media as opposed to planned interventions. A such, Palestine solidarity organizations may benefit from moving past a strategic focus on persuading American Jews to become more critical of Israel and instead shift towards a greater emphasis on spreading information about the occupation and mobilizing their existing supporters.\r\nThese findings also add a new layer of critique to the scholarship on planned interventions such as dialogue and peace education programs (Aouragh 2016; Abu-Nimer 2001; Gawerc 2006; Hubbard 2001; Maoz 2000; Ross 2017; Rothstein 1999; Schneider 2019). In addition to reinforcing power imbalances and being indebted to neoliberal donors, the data from this study suggest that such programs play a marginal role in building the bases of more radical organizations. In contrast to anecdotal stories of major political transformations among Jewish Palestine solidarity activists, most activists in this study appear to have long held critical views of Israel. Furthermore, when activists did experience a major shift in their thinking, it was more often due to media coverage of current events than interfaith or dialogue programs.\r\nThis study offers several broad implications that extend beyond the specific context of diaspora Jews\u2019 solidarity with Palestine. First, media remains a powerful tool to generate solidarity with oppressed populations in the Global South. Most people who become activists do not need to be coerced into supporting such causes, instead, they need access to accurate information that informs them of injustices occurring abroad. This conclusion leads to the second wider implication of this study. Organizations that strive for radical social change may have more to gain from strengthening their existing bases than attempting to dramatically shift the mindsets of their opposition. In other words, organizations should not focus on converting its opponents at the expense of supporting those who are currently engaged in struggle. Finally, in contrast to dominant approaches to the subject of Jewish support for Palestinians, this study suggests that Jewish solidarity with Palestine is not typically the result of hard-won ideological conversion, it is instead an accessible, and even obvious, political orientation for many American Jews.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nThis research would not have been possible without the support of Samantha Brotman at Jewish Voice for Peace as well as Jamie Baum, whose 2018 senior thesis provided the groundwork for this article\u2019s statistical analyses.\r\n\r\nWorks Cited\r\nAbu-Nimer, Mohammed. 2001.

style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This study analyzes how a number of Arab newspapers approach water issues and the different perspectives they present about the water crises and water insecurity in the region. The paper examines the extent to which the framing of the topic tends to escalate the issue using conflict theory, or de-escalate it using what the author calls ‘adaptive-compatibility’ frames. Adaptive-compatibility methods are defined in this article as the ways in which the news attempts to portray the issue in a conciliatory manner, where they offer solutions and endeavor to de-escalate the crisis. Applying quantitative methods, the research analyzes 183 articles on the issue of water. The sample was drawn from articles published from January 2019 to April 2021, in six Arab newspapers: </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Al-Ahram, Asharq Al-Awsat, Al-Riyadh, Al-Zaman, An-Nahar, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Al-Ghad</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. The analysis demonstrated that the most prominent frame in the sample is one based on conflict. It was found that nearly 60% of the sample included the introduction of some kind of conflict over water resources, whether by referring to conflict mechanisms only or referring to the conflict and adaptive-compatibility mechanisms combined. The results also indicated that there is evident effort being exerted by the authors to communicate their concerns about water issues to the public and to decision-makers. Accordingly, the predominant approach to water issues by journalists in Arab countries is alarmist, focused on crises, and warning of impending conflicts over water. The research proposed a conceptual model of interpretation to help in understanding and predicting how conflicts over water resources are represented or going to be framed in newspaper articles.</span></p><div class=""page"" title=""Page 1""><div class=""layoutArea""><div class=""column""><h3 style=""direction: rtl;""><strong>أطر معالجة مواد الرأي في الصحف العربية ل</strong><strong>قضايا المياه: </strong><strong>دراسة تحليلية في</strong> <strong>ضوء نظرية الصراع</strong></h3><p style=""direction: rtl; text-align: justify;"">يحاول البحث الراهن تحليل أطر معالجة عينة من مقالات الصحف العربية لقضايا المياه في ضوء نظرية الصراع؛ للكشف عن مدى ميل المعالجة إلى تبني الأطر المعبرة عن تصعيد الصراع، أو بالمقابل، تبني الأطر المعبرة عن تهدئة الصراع، أو ما أطلق عليه في البحث الأطر المعبرة عن ""الآليات التكيفية – التوافقية"". وقد عرَّف البحث أطر ""الآليات التكيفية – التوافقية""، بأنَّها الأطر التي تركز على إمكانيات التصدي ذاتيًا لحل مشكلات المياه، أو تحسين طرق إدارتها، أو التركيز على ضرورة تبني الأساليب التوافقية والتعاونية مع الطرف المناوئة في الصراع على المياه. وقد اعتمد البحث في جمع البيانات على تطبيق أسلوب تحليل المضمون الكمي لأطر معالجة قضايا المياه بالمقالات المنشورة خلال الفترة من 1 يناير إلى 30 أبريل 2021 في خمس صحف عربية، هى: الأهرام، الرياض، الغد، الشرق الاوسط، الزمان، النهار. وكشف تحليل الأطر أنَّ أكثر الأطر بروزًا في العينة هو إطار الصراع، كما تبين أن ما يقرب من 60% من عينة المقالات تضمنت طرح آلية ما من آليات الصراع على الموارد المائية، سواء عبر الإشارة للآليات الصراعية فقط أو الإشارة إلى الآليتين الصراعية و""التكيفية – التوافقية"" مجتمعتين. وتشير النتائج أيضًا إلى وجود تخوفات بشأن قضية المياه لدى القائمين بالاتصال يحاولون التعبير عنها ونقلها للرأي العام وصانع القرار؛ وبالتالي فإن المنظور المسيطر على إدراك كتاب المقالات بشأن قضايا المياه في البلدان العربية هو تبني منظور الأزمة الذي ينذر بحدوث صراع على المياه. وخلص البحث إلى اقتراح نموذج نظري للتفسير يساعد في فهم وتوقع الكيفية التي يتم من خلالها تقديم الصراعات على موارد المياه في المقالات الصحفية، كما يساعد في توقع ما إذا كان هذا التقديم سيركز على تصعيد الصراع أو على الدعوة إلى خفض التصعيد.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=""clear""></div></div> <script type=""application/ld+json"">{""@context"":""http:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""NewsArticle"",""dateCreated"":""2022-02-27T09:25:25+00:00"",""datePublished"":""2022-02-27T09:25:25+00:00"",""dateModified"":""2022-08-29T12:48:24+00:00"",""headline"":""The Framing of Water Issues in Opinion Articles of Arab Newspapers An Analytical Study Based on Conflict Theory (Arabic)"",""name"":""The Framing of Water Issues in Opinion Articles of Arab Newspapers An Analytical Study Based on Conflict Theory (Arabic)"",""keywords"":[],""url"":""https:\/\/www.arabmediasociety.com\/the-framing-of-water-issues-in-opinion-articles-of-arab-newspapers-an-analytical-study-based-on-conflict-theory-arabic\/"",""description"":""Scroll down for Arabic abstract.
